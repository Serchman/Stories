**** Intro:** A vignette of an ailing city.

The blood from the dying sun spilled into the sky above the city. The city's
own lifeblood seemed to congeal and coagulate in the shadows of one particular
vein - Mandella Place, home of the dispossessed.  
  
  
At the heart of this gathering, Eris checked her daughter's pulse and examined
the scene reflected in her fixed pupils. It was over, the struggle; she closed
the eyelids; laid her white jacket over the small red shape.  
  
  
It was only when she drew back that her composure shattered from her knees
upwards. She wept, unashamedly in the open street. Not one of the other girls
offered comfort; their scarlet clothes hung guiltily on their gaunt frames as
they gradually skulked back into the darkness leaving the pair, destroyed on
the sidewalk. Eris was numb to the melting of the crowd. There would be no
investigation - morgue marriage for death. No funeral. But there would be ash.  
  
  
Eris leant over her daughter to place her favourite teddy in her arms. Kissing
her head, she rose, already reaching for her phone to report the crime.  
  
  
Eris stood up, a speck of dignity amidst a wash of filth.  
  
  
Only two boys remained with her, pretending to shoot each with pale fingers.
