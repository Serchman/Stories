**** Intro:** the second in the series

"A coma?" My mind was racing. No, I remember doing all those things...the car,
the attacks, Jack, the agency...but Fox's run-in was today...just five minutes
ago. Then it hit me. It hit me like a freight train. All that stuff did
happen. It happened a year ago. I was replaying all the events in my head
until my "death." Once I was finally shot, I woke up. "Those strange
voices...of course!" I yelled to myself.  
  
"Holly, it's mommy." She sounded tired. "We are so worried about you. Holly,
honey...I'm sorry about that thing...it felt like I couldn't stop...I think
Mick used drugs or someth-" I heard another voice in the back round.
"Oh..okay. The doctor said I had to leave...bye sweetheart...I love you."  
Mick use drugs to drug my mom?  
"Where is everyone?"  
"Who?" The nurse asked  
"My family..."  
"Holly...it's been a year and three months. They gave up and went home, they
visited you every week for ten months. Jack...I think that's his name...he
really held on."  
I smiled to myself. Sounds like Jack.  
"Thanks."  
"Do you want me to contact your family for you?"  
"No thanks," I said resolutely, "I'll stop by."  
"Miss, when are you planning to leave?"  
"Today. I've been here for too long."  
"But we have to run some tests."  
"Let's do it."  
  
The sun felt warm on my face as I boarded the public bus. I decided to stop by
at my parents' house first. Getting off the bus, I squinted into the sunlight.
I wanted to visit my family and change out of the only pair of clothes I
had... the shirt had a hole in the chest...and I had a matching scar. (but the
blood was washed out) Their house looked dark. My heart started beating faster
as I walked to the door. I knew something was wrong...I could just feel it. I
turned the doorknob, and the door swung open on its own. I gasped, felt my
insides turn. Everything was destroyed. All furniture, lamps, doors, a few
back windows were smashed, the TV's, the stereo, curtains torn, and carpets
ripped up. I felt a chill run down my spine as I walked through, calling out
the names of my family members. I looked down as I stepped on something lumpy,
it was my purse! I found my old cash and cards still there. They obviously
didn't want money.  
Another electric chill ran down my spine as I saw the only evidence/clue I
would need as to where they were and how this happened. Upon a wall, written
as if in a hurry, was one word.  
Mick.  
It was scribbled with a red crayon in big letters. My fear turned to anger. I
vowed to find Mick and my family members. I vowed to destroy my half brother.
I walked back out into the sunshine, but this time it wasn't as warm.  
  
I stood outside my apartment building, looking up into what used to be my
home. It was now filled with foreign things. I could see from the balcony/fire
escape. Jack must've sold my place. No...where is all my stuff? I decided to
go back to my parents' house, I only wanted one thing. My car.  
My car was still there, sitting with a tarp over it. I sat in it, running my
hands over the steering wheel, and backed out through the garage door. Need to
change. I wanted to get out of the clothes I was in...they spooked me. Maybe
because I was shot in them... I need to find Jack. I drove to the one place
where I could find everything. The mall. I bought clothes and changed in the
dressing room. I combed over my appearance and headed out to buy a few more
things. My savings account was just the way I left it, very full. I would be
able to live a few more weeks on it alone, though I had no intention of doing
so. I bought a suitcase, toiletries, a few clothes, and some food. I went to a
hotel and made some calls to my parents' cells phones. None were working. My
cell phone had been shutoff also. Someone knocked on my door. I opened it,
seeing a bellman waiting.  
"Get inside," he growled roughly, pushing me in and following after.  
"What the-"  
"I got a message from Fox." My heart skipped a beat.  
"Oh yeah?" I smiled. "Well, I got a message for him too." I punched the man in
the face before he could realize what was happening. I brought my knee up into
his stomach, knocking the wind out of him. He grabbed my throat and pushed me
against a wall. My throat was closed; my brain was bursting with activity
though none of it made sense. I kicked him in the chest, bringing my arms up
and through his, them slamming them down on his arms. His grip broke. I gasped
for air, sweet precious air...then I kicked the guy in the stomach sending him
flying into a chair.  
"Don't move." I gasped. "Tell me what Mickey boy has to say."  
"He knows you're alive." He made no move to get up. "He has your family. They
put up a good fight." He sneered. "But had to finally admit where you were. He
knows."  
"Where is he?" He just looked at me. "WHERE ARE THEY?" I closed my eyes to
think. This guy would die before he gave it away.  
"He will come to you." His voice made me jump.  
"He will not find me."  
"How do you think I'm here tonight?"  
"Give this to him for me." I punched the guy, and threw him out in the hall
with a black eye.  
  
I sat down in a chair in my room. How was I going to disappear from these
guys? I need to find some refuge, I need another identity- I stopped my mind
from racing. I frowned. Something in me changed, something clicked, as if it
was supposed to be there my whole life. Why am I running? I thought. I'm tired
of running. I will run, no more. I will be the enemy. I will be the only thing
the notorious Fox fears. I will be the shadow, I will take control. I am the
fear factor. I am the one person he will know to never make angry. I am the
hunter. My mind was made up. I was going back to the UDCU headquarters. I was
going to need weapons.  
  
I walked in the doors, punching in the number in the keypad. I prayed it was
still the same. If it was wrong, alarms would go off and rush forces would
surround me. That... would be humiliating. The light above the door turned
green and it clicked to unlock. I breathed a sigh of relief. I walked to the
IF commander's office.  
"Commander Hughes?" I asked, stepping in. He was reading the newspaper.  
"One minute..." he mumbled. He filled in the last word to the crossword
puzzle. "Alright...he took off his spectacles, who dares to bother-" I took
one look at me and dropped the items he was holding. "Ho- Hol- Ho- Holly?" He
spat in disbelief.  
"Yes...sir." I said.  
He pressed his intercom. "Tell Courtney to get in here with my coffee."  
"Coming sir."  
"Holly. How did you...what are you going to...how are you?" He finally asked.  
"Swell, sir. And yourself?"  
"I'm, well, good." I heard footsteps in the hall behind us. Turning around I
saw Courtney. She, dropped the Frapaccino she was holding.  
"Holly." She whispered. Spinning around, she ran down the hallways all the
while yelling, "Holly's back! Holly's back!" soon there was a large crowd
outside the room. I turned and saw the familiar green eyes.  
"Jack." I breathed. He was standing behind a few people. He pushed through the
crowd. He stepped toward me.  
"Holly." He smiled as my heart melted. I reached for his hand. Tears were in
his eyes. My head spun. No one else was in the room, it seemed.  
"Jack!" The voice broke into our private world. "Jack!" My former co-rush
mate, Jenny pushed through everyone and ran up. "Baby! Here you are!" She
kissed him on the cheek. He didn't look at her. My stomach turned to lead; a
tear fell down my face. Everyone else came swimming back. My breathing
returned and others came up, pushing Jack and Jenny out.  
Then I recognized someone else. "Boone!" I cried, hugging him tightly.  
"Holly!" I smiled as a whirlwind of people rushed up and all around me. Jack
was nowhere. I pushed him out of my mind.  
  
The red alarm went off. Everyone had gone back to work, agreeing that we were
going to have a party tomorrow, in honor of my waking. Everyone rushed to
their stations. I was in the training room when it went off. I ran to gear up.
I felt a hand on my shoulder.  
"Holly, let's speak in my office." I turned and saw Commander Hughes standing
there.  
"...But the alert!" I cried, continuing to suit up.  
"Holly!" He yelled, growing impatient. I stopped, for the first time noticing
the look in his eye. We walked down to his office. He sat in his chair and I
sat on the opposite side of his desk.  
"Holly." He idly played with a paperweight on his desk. "We can't have you on
the force anymore."  
"What?" I asked, smiling. This couldn't be real. This is a dream. Another
coma! Right? Right?  
"We can't have the incidentals. Your condition is unstable. We can't afford
another year for you in the hospital." He stared at the floor.  
"When were you going to cut me off?" I asked, choking over my closing throat.  
"Another month."  
"Look at me." I demanded. I was demanding an answer from a commander. "Look at
ME!" I screamed. "I was shot, I GAVE MY LIFE FOR THIS!" I shrieked.  
"Holly...please."  
"PLEASE WHAT HUGHES?"  
"I didn't want to be the one to tell you...it wasn't my decision."  
"Who's was it."  
"Our funding company."  
"the government?"  
"yes."  
"This is all I have." I groaned.  
"I'm sorry."  
"No...NO YOU ARE NOT!" Anger was consuming my body, my vision went black. "I
have nothing left." I gasped. I spun around, seeing Jack at the door.  
"Am I interrupting?"  
"No. I was just leaving." I said. "For good."  
"Holly, this is yours." He gave me a box. "It's your fathers share of this
unit."  
"You're giving up on him too?" I mumbled, not wanting to hear the answer.  
"What more can we do?" My chest was closing. I turned around and looked Jack
in the eye, as everything went black. I opened my eyes, on the ground. Jack
was kneeling beside me. Others were standing around me.  
"Are you okay?" Jack asked. I hated the concerned look in his eye. Some
people, including Jack, took my hand and arms, to help me up.  
"Get off of me!" I shrieked. They jumped back.  
"Holly..." Jack looked pained.  
"Don't touch me." I growled through clenched teeth. I stood up on my own and
pushed my way roughly through the crowd.  
  
"Holly!" I heard while walking to my car. "Holly!" I turned around. Boone was
running toward me. "I quit."  
"What?" I frowned.  
"I quit, partner. You're not there, neither am I." I smiled. I heard a door
slam. Looking over, I saw Jack running toward me. I signaled for Boone to get
in my car. He did.  
"Holly." Jack said.  
"Jack." I mumbled.  
"Holly, please I quit."  
"You too?"  
"I quit a couple of weeks ago."  
"Why are you still here?"  
"Two weeks notice."  
"And Boone?"  
"He's more irrational than I am." He smiled. My knees weakened.  
"I thought you were going to wait for me."  
"I did...for a while. Then someone convinced me otherwise."  
"Who?"  
"Your father."  
"What?"  
"He said you would want me to be happy. So I continued on with my life."  
"I'm going to miss you, Jack." It was true, I would. I left him. I left him
standing in the middle of the parking lot. I left the building that had become
my passion. I left the life I used to own. I left my fears, I left my heart
behind. I had nothing left to give. I was preparing to become a monster, to
get the only thing I could get back. My family.  
  
"Boone."  
"Yeah?"  
"Where are we?"  
"Holly...the doctor said this would happen."  
"What would happen? Where ARE WE?" I started thrashing. A light clicked on.
Something about the room I was in was vaguely familiar.  
"He said you might forget things...not memory loss, but you that had slight
brain damage. He said parts of your brain turned off, forcing some information
to leave, because you can't contain it. We stopped at this hotel about..." He
checked his watch. "four hours ago."  
I noticed my breathing was speeding up. "Why now?" I asked. "I could remember
everything back there!"  
"That wasn't new information Holly, just try to forget some things back
there."  
"I'm sorry Boone."  
"Don't apologize." I closed my eyes again.  
  
I looked over at Boone, sleeping on the couch. He was slightly unshaven, mouth
closed, arm carelessly thrown over his eyes. Man he's cute. I thought. No. not
again. I vowed not to ever tell anyone of my crush on Boone. I couldn't deal
with a relationship again. I got up and took a shower and got dressed. As I
was putting on make-up I saw Boone staring at me in the mirror. I smiled at
him.  
"Good morning, sleepy head."  
"Yeah...same to you." He smiled at me. I turned to go past him, but he didn't
move.  
"Can I help you?"  
"No, you've helped me enough,"  
"What'd you mean?" He walked towards me, pushing me up against a wall.  
"Boone?" He leaned down and kissed me. Pulling back I stood with my eyes
closed for about five more seconds. "What was that for?"  
"I love you."  
"What?" I asked. "But..."  
"Way before Jack ever did. We went to high school together. You never knew
me...but I knew you. We were introduced, you forgot about me. But I found out
we liked the same thing...fighting." He laughed. "When I found out you were in
the UDCU...I requested to be your partner."  
"Boone..."  
"Don't say anything." There was a knock on the door. I moved around him, and
opened the door.  
"Jack!" I said, frowning.  
"Holly, please just listen. I love you." This can't be happening! I thought.
"When I saw you...conscious...you have no idea how happy that made me. I
waited for you. I was ready to wait a lifetime. I dumped Jenny."  
"How'd you find me?"  
"The UDCU is more advanced that you know."  
"That's, um...kind of creepy."  
"I know. But I want to be with you." Oh God. Boone stepped out of the
bathroom.  
"Jack." He said; a slight hint of hatred on his tone.  
"Hey, Boone, old buddy." Jack smiled, but the smile wasn't friendly. It sent
chills up and down my spine.  
"Guys...what's going on?"  
"Jack and I just have some issues." Boone's eyes never left Jack. Neither did
Jack's.  
"You know I got there first Boone. Just accept that I found it, and you
didn't. The Commander believes me."  
"What are you talking about?" I raised my voice, but neither seemed to notice.  
"You're a lying scumbag." Boone hissed.  
"You're a stealing pig." I had heard enough. I spun around and ran through the
open door. I heard footsteps behind me. I punched the down arrow for the
elevator. Come on, come on. It opened. I jumped in and repeatedly pressed the
"close door" button. I saw Jack turn the corner, and run over, but the doors
closed. I sighed. Close call.  
I got out of the elevator and ground level and walked over to the now-closing
breakfast bar. A cold voice spoke in my ear,  
"Remember me?" I closed my eyes. Mick.  
"How could I forget? I mean, you only shot me but...I have a good memory." I
smiled sarcastically. I prayed he wouldn't catch the quavering fear in my
voice.  
"Oh, come on, sis. Usually people forget about those things, let's put it
behind us." I still didn't turn around and I just continued putting whipped
cream on my bagel.  
"I thought about forgiving you...but then I found out you stole my family. And
I decided not to forgive you...I just want them back."  
"Good luck. They're dead." Fox breathed cynically.  
"You're bluffing." I swallowed hard. He's lying. I fought to gain control of
my shaking hands and spinning vision. "You're LYING!" I spun around to face
him, but no one was there. People stared at me like I was crazy. "My
brother...he was just next to me and..." I started to explain but they soon
lost interest and went back to eating.  
I gathered my bagel and walked back toward the elevator. A hand reached out
and grabbed me. I was dizzy and nauseous and all my insides were ice.  
"Get off!" I screamed. "Get off of me!" I saw Boone was the one holding me. He
tried to hug me. I dropped my bagel. "OFF!" People were staring. I screeched.
I was fighting him, struggling to get away. I knew it was Boone, and I knew I
wanted to be with him, but for some reason I couldn't stop. I felt his arms
trying to coax me to him. My legs gave out. Where was I? What was I doing
here? Where was my father? "Ahhhhh...uh." I screamed but felt pain on my head,
I drifted out of consciousness.  
  
  
I opened my eyes. My head was sore and I vaguely remembered what happened
before I woke up, but not much. I remember Mick...and people and my bagel.  
"Where's my bagel?" I said into thin air. No one was in the room. I sat up. I
was on the hotel bed, I heard voices; voices coming from the hall. Getting up,
I groggily walked over to the door and was going to open it, but then I heard
my name.  
"...Holly will be like that for awhile. The doctor said." I recognized Jack's
voice. "Are you really prepared to do this for awhile...possibly the rest of
both your lives? I know you love her, but are you going to give it all up for
her? She needs that kind of attention. You clearly aren't handling the first
time well." I looked through the peephole. Boone was sitting against the
opposite wall, his knees bent in front of him. His elbows were on his knees,
and his head was resting in his hands. I couldn't see his face. "I can do it.
I'm ready." Jack was standing up beside him, leaning against the wall.  
"Boone," I breathed. I felt bad for Boone, but at the same time I was mad. I
was mad for them treating me like I wasn't human. I'll show them. My mind will
be fully functional soon. Tears filled my eyes. I flung open the door and ran
over to where Boone was sitting. I knelt in front of him. "Boone, I'm so
sorry. I never meant to do that." He looked up for a second. I could tell he
was troubled, possibly was crying. He hid his face again.  
"Holly!" Jack said loudly, he looked surprised.  
"Boone." I pleaded, "Please look at me." He didn't move. I reached over and
put my hands on his. He still didn't move. "Boone!"  
"Holly, come on. Boone just needs some time." Jack came over and lifted me off
the ground.  
"Boone!" I cried. "Please!" There was silence in the hallway. Jack stood with
his hands on my waist. We both stared at Boone. He moved slightly, but didn't
respond or look up. I let Jack lead me away.  
  
"You manipulated him." I squinted at Jack.  
"I had to. I can't let him steal you."  
"It wouldn't be stealing if it was consensual."  
"You...you, um, love him?"  
"I...I don't know." I sputtered. He looked at me long and hard.  
"I love you. I just want you to be happy."  
"Really?"  
"I would prefer it not be with him." He smiled. I playfully hit him on the
arm.  
"You're right. I can't let him throw away his life looking after me." I said.  
"I just don't want him tricking you into something you don't want."  
"I know. You're a good guy." I looked into his brilliant green eyes. He gave
me one of his old looks that made my heart beat faster. I'm still in love with
Jack...but who do I want more? I thought. I stepped closer to him.  
"I can't let you either." I whispered.  
"I can make up my own mind, thank you." His eyes shone out playfully. My
memory hit me like a train.  
"Fox!" I cried. "He was here, in this very hotel..." My mind was going one
hundred miles an hour. "...he told me that my family was dead and I thought he
was bluffing and he just disappeared into the crowd and people thought I was
crazy and then I felt Boone's hand and I was so shaken up I didn't know what I
was doing and I-"  
"Holly!" Jack raised his voice over mine, which was getting higher by the
second. "Holly, listen to me. Breathe. Calm down, now. Start again."  
"Mick is...or...was here." I said, collecting myself.  
"How'd he find you?"  
"I don't know, but that's what scares me." I backed away from Jack. "You." I
said. "It was you." I accused.  
"Holly, never say that again." Jack said sternly. He had a serious look in his
eye. "I want to kill him." He said simply.  
"Jack, I'm sorry..." I began.  
"No...don't be. You have a right to suspect everyone." We heard a strangled
cry from the hallway. I looked at Jack.  
"Boone." We said at the same time. I spun around and ran out the door. Boone
was still against the wall, but he was trying to stop blood flowing from an
open wound in his side. All of a sudden I knew. I knew how Boone got it, I
knew I would have to kick the guy ready to jump out from my immediate left,
and I knew there were about five guys waiting to be called for backup. I
didn't know how, but I knew. I sprung into action. I kicked the guy in the
chest and caught the knife that went flying out of his hand from contact. I
back-kicked another man who ran at my back, I threw the knife into the arm of
another coming from my left, pinning him against the wall. I couldn't hear
anything. I couldn't hear the surprised gasp of the guys I kicked; I couldn't
hear the scream of the guy I pinned to the wall. I just looked for my next two
targets, I saw them coming together; rushing me from the front, Bad idea. I
bent and sent them flying over my back onto the floor. The world came rushing
back. Boone and Jack stared at me, mouths open.  
"Don't let them all get away. Question them." I said to Jack, even though I
already knew all I needed to know. Mick. The three I knocked out earlier in
the fight ran off, but Jack caught the two who went over me.  
I, of course, ran to Boone. He grimaced in pain as I inspected the wound.  
"Deep, but thin. No need for stitches." I looked at him.  
"I'm sorry." He mumbled. "I'm...sorry." He buried his head in my shoulder.  
"It's okay Boone." I helped him up and into the room. Jack was still
interrogating the attackers. Boone collapsed into a chair. I got my first aid-
kit. I lifted his shirt and wrapped the cut with gauze. I looked back up at
him, his brown eyes were brooding and he was staring into space. I turned his
face toward me. His eyes focused on mine, and my heart skipped a beat. He
tried to lean toward me, but inhaled sharply in pain. I came up to him. And I
kissed him. I kissed Boone. I chose Boone. I love Boone. And Jack was standing
in the doorway.  
  
"So you've made your decision." Jack nodded. He turned around and walked out.
I pulled away and ran after him.  
"Jack!" He stopped, but didn't look back. "I need you with me. Please come."  
"I can't."  
"Why?"  
"I don't want to."  
"Why?" He spun around.  
"Why? Why...you ask? Because I can not be with you, without wanting to be with
you." I looked at him.  
"Jack...please. Please." I looked at him. "I need you." He slowly walked back
toward me.  
"Okay...but I need a different room, I'll take my car...and-" he was cut off
by my excited hug.  
"Jack...thank you, thank you, thank you! You can any thing you want and I
swear I'll stay away...well not too far away..."  
"Holly!" Jack gasped. "Please let go! I can't breathe!"  
"Oh, sorry." I smiled sheepishly.  
"Hey partner." I heard Boone's voice behind me. He was leaning heavily against
the doorframe.  
"Boone!" I said, rushing over to help him. I looked over at Jack, standing in
the hall, watching me. I felt a pang of emotion. I still love Jack. I
regretted asking him to stay.  
  
I decided to let my confused heart go for a little while. Stop focusing on
love. I told myself. Focus on one thing...one thing only. Fox. The name I
hated the most. I would have to focus on defeating him first, and then go to
priority number two; my love life.  
  
We stayed in the hotel for the night. Jack slept in the room next to us. I
decided Boone shouldn't travel anywhere for the day, so Jack and I went out to
eat. We brought food back for Boone. We swam, at ten o'clock, when the pool
closed, Jack went back upstairs and I took a shower. I got dressed in
oversized pajamas, and stepped out of the bathroom.  
"She finally emerges." Boone said, a playful smile on his face.  
"Shut up." I joked. I went over to help him sit up. He cried out in pain.
"Boone," I said sympathetically. I un-wrapped his gauze and looked at the cut.
I looked like it hurt very badly, it could easily get infected. I bit my lower
lip.  
"I'm guessing it doesn't look too good."  
"How do you figure?"  
"You just bit your bottom lip," I looked up and saw him staring back.  
"When's the last time you took Advil?" I asked.  
"I don't know...six, maybe seven hours ago."  
"Boone!" I cried in dismay. "It's worn off; this must hurt like...who knows!"  
"Yeah..." He said, sucking in air through clenched teeth. "It does." We looked
at each other for a little while. I kissed him quickly. I was trying not to,
but I couldn't help it. Curse you...love life! I thought.  
"That helped a bit." He said, smiling. I rolled my eyes. "I need to go to the
bathroom." He confessed. I helped him up, all the while he was gritting in
pain. I sat down at the end of the bed after helping him to the bathroom. I
heard him getting sick. Springing up, I ran to the bathroom door.  
"Boone?" I cried frantically. "Do you need to go to the hospital?" He opened
the door, looking a little pale, and brushed his teeth.  
"Naw," He said nonchalantly. "I just don't feel too good."  
"Obviously!"  
"Listen to me." I looked up at him. "I'm okay." I gently hugged him, and
helped him back to his bed. But I didn't trust him.  
"Where are you going?" he asked, as I headed toward the door.  
"...To get a second opinion." I said. I was going to get Jack.  
  
"Huh? What do you want?" Jack growled, rubbing the sleep away from his eyes.
He was only wearing pajama pants and his brown hair was ruffled.  
"Wow. I hope this is how you treat all people when they come to the door." I
said sarcastically.  
"Nope, only the special ones." He smiled showing all his teeth in more of a
grimace.  
"How cute."  
"Awww, shucks." He said, mock blushing.  
"Shut up. Listen, Boone isn't doing too well and I need your opinion."  
"Opinion?"  
"...If he should go to the hospital or not..." He followed me into my room.
Boone had his eyes shut and was biting his lower lip. Oh God! I thought,
rushing over to him. "Jack!" I cried. Jack came up behind me.  
"Let me see it." I lifted up his shirt, and un-wrapped the gauze. Boone
grunted. I looked up at Jack, who suddenly very serious. "No hospital yet.
Boone, listen to me. This is going to be a very, very painful night." He
looked at me. "Make him as comfortable as you can. Boone, if it starts to burn
like fire...that's when we need to go." He nodded at me and left.  
"Boone, I'm so sorry ...this is all my fault. If I never freaked out and
freaked you out you wouldn't have been in the hallway." I stopped because he
grabbed me hand and shook his head.  
"Shut up." He whispered. I smiled through my tears.  
  
Try as I might, I couldn't fall asleep that night. I would wake up every five
to fifteen minutes and lay there for about a half an hour. Sometimes Boone
would cry out in pain and I would attend to him, but other than that he was
okay. I just thought of Fox, and how I was going to like hurting him. (As he
had enjoyed hurting everyone I loved.) I finally fell asleep to get a few
hours of rest, but when dawn came, and we were going to check out I felt dead.
I threw myself out of my bed so I could wake.  
"Holly?" I heard Boone say softly. "Are you okay?" I managed to stand up.  
"Yeah...I just barely slept, that's all." I coughed and rubbed my eyes. Boone
sat up in his bed.  
"Think I can take a shower?" He inquired.  
"If you feel well enough." He nodded. I helped him out of bed, and into the
bathroom. I took a shower after him and pretty soon we were ready to go. "I'll
go get Jack." I knocked. He opened up, smiling his silly smile.  
"Ready?" Jack said in his, "lets-go-get-'em," too happy voice.  
"Ugh. Are you human?" I groaned. "It's seven in the morning."  
"...Only on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays after twelve o'clock..."  
"Figures." Jack and I packed up the cars and I got Boone situated in the front
seat.  
"You okay?" I asked him.  
"Yeah...yeah I am." He smiled.  
"I'll follow you!" I called to Jack.  
"Where exactly am I going?" He called back.  
"Arizona!"  
"Huh?"  
"ARIZONA!"  
"ooookay, well, we're in South Carolina now, how do you plan on getting
there?"  
"Follow the map! I wrote it all down." He looked at the map frowning, and
scratched his head. The map was upside down. This is going to be a long trip.
I thought.  
  
It actually wasn't going to be as long as I thought. We were through Georgia
by nightfall. Boone was talking to keep me awake.  
"I thought, you know, that maybe he had gone around the back way...but he
wasn't there. By this time I had my gun pulled, just in case he leapt out and
tried to kill me. And suddenly...Holly, Holly?"  
"Oh yeah...I'm sorry Boone." Even before the trip, Boone and I knew a lot
about each other; the product of many coffee-room breaks. But now, if there
was something I didn't know about Boone, I would be very, very surprised. I'm
sure he felt the same way about me. That's why I was spacing. "I'm sorry." I
said.  
"No...it's okay. I know, you're tired." (That too.) I smiled at him. I looked
back at the road, we were driving on a road out in the country. I watched in
horror as Jack's truck went over the guardrail and disappeared from sight. I
stopped the car and jumped out. I ran over to the spot where the guardrail was
broken in. My heart was pounding in my ears and I couldn't breathe. I looked
down the hill and saw Jack's truck smashed into a tree. Oh God! I ran down the
hill, and grabbed the truck's handle on the driver's side. I pulled really
hard, but nothing happened. I saw Jack, passed out in the front seat. Tears
were running down my face as I tried all the doors, none of which opened. I
punched the window, which broke. I stared at my hand, which had large shards
of glass in it, yet I felt no pain. I looked up and saw Boone, outlined by the
other cars' headlights he flagged down.  
"Jack!" I screamed. "JACK!" His eyelids fluttered, than opened. He groaned.  
  
  
The hospital was white. Boone and I walked down the hallways. Some people
stared in disgust at my hand, while others glanced and thought it to be
perfectly normal. They also looked at Boone's wound and helped him with what
they could. Jack had a concussion and his left shoulder was dislocated.  
"You know, it'd be really sweet if you guys would stop getting hurt."  
"Well, I'm terribly sorry I inconvenienced you by swerving to save a poor
helpless animal, causing myself a lot of excruciating pain." Jack grunted.  
"I forgive you...just don't let it happen again." I smiled at him.  
  
We left Jack's truck in Georgia, he couldn't drive anyways. I drove with Boone
sitting in front, Jack in the back seat. We arrived in Arizona with few more
complications, with the exception of Jack and Boone arguing, and me
threatening to leave them to fend for themselves.  
"...Any suggestions on how to find Fox?" I asked, while we were eating at a
diner on the side of the highway.  
"Hall of records?" Boone suggested.  
"Those don't even exist." Jack countered.  
"Yes, they do." Boone frowned.  
"Shut up!" I cried. "Okay...we'll see if they exist and then...duh. He'll have
a fake name. Hall of records is out. How do we infiltrate Fox's lair?" They
looked at each other. "Shut up. It just came to me."  
"I like that...Fox's lair." Jack said, smiling.  
"Yeah...me too-"  
"I don't care!" I raised my voice over theirs. "Do you think he'll come to
me?"  
"I know he will." Boone said, narrowing his eyes into space. "In some way or
other...remember, you still have something he wants. And Fox doesn't stop
until he has what he wants," I nodded.  
"Let's stay somewhere in the open tonight. I have a friend down here, her name
is Tiffany. She's staying with her brother, Gabe; they're both in the UDCU.
We'll make ourselves easy targets." I made the phone call and we were all set.  
  
Jack and Tiff hit it off instantly. I couldn't help but feel a little jealous.
They smiled and laughed together. She flaunted her girlish figure and he
smiled his charming smile. I met Gabe, who slightly resembled his sister, but
in a more masculine way. He had blond hair, brown eyes. He didn't look like
Boone (puppy-like) and he didn't look like Jack (clean-cut), he looked like a
model. He was cute, but I feverishly hoped his model looks would be exact
opposite from a model's demeanor. They lived in a small house in a gated
neighborhood. Tiff showed us where to sleep. I was going to sleep with her and
the boys in the guest room. That night, after the sound of Jack and Tiff's
laughter faded from my ears I lay in bed, yet I couldn't get to sleep.
Restlessly I walked to the kitchen to get a glass of warm milk. I read a note
on her whiteboard that was stuck on the fridge. Milk, eggs, pretzels. Shopping
list. I kept reading. Then I read five words that turned my blood cold, my
insides melted. It's sooner than you'll expect. A hand covered my mouth.  
"You always were a slow reader." I heard Mick's taunting voice. I elbowed him
in the stomach.  
"...Prepared, nonetheless..." I breathed, he was doubled over and he coughed a
little. I punched him in the face, send his head back. He spun around, kicking
out his leg, sending me sprawling on the ground. He tried to step on my face,
but I grabbed his leg and twisted, bringing him down with me. He jumped on me
before I could get the high ground and started choking me. I brought me knee
hard into his groin. He groaned and rolled off. I punched him repeatedly in
the face, and jumped up. He got up quicker than I anticipated and took hold of
my hair, slamming me head into the refrigerator. He slammed me against the
counter, and all the utensils clattered on the floor. I could hear voices, but
they sounded distant. I started to get really mad, thinking of all he's done
to me. I turned around and punched him, kicked him and hit him across the face
with the frying pan I found on the counter. He hit it away, but I could feel
his fear. I could almost taste it. Anger drove me more than any motive he had.
I grabbed his head and brought it down to meet my knee. Flung his head up and
hit under my chin, giving me whiplash. I went with the movement, though and
used it to my advantage. I linked my hands together and swung them up as my
head went back, giving me momentum, I hit under his head, knocking him into
the pantry. I knew I had won, he was reeling. I smiled at him. I prepared to
kick him, one last time. That's when I heard a scream and looked down towards
a sharp pain in my stomach. I saw a knife protruding from the wound Fox had
just cheated to throw into me. I gasped and fell back into the counter. The
next thing I knew, Jack was helping me with his good arm. I looked back and
saw Boone, Tiff, and Gabe trying to hold Mick down. Jack helped me sit in a
chair. I was focused on Jack's face to stop thinking about the pain.  
"Oh God." He said, "Holly..." He looked into my eyes, and I smiled at him.
Everything went black.  
  
I opened my eyes in light. The sun was shining through the curtain. I looked
over and saw Jack next to me, asleep.  
"Jack," I whispered with difficulty. He woke up instantly.  
"Holly." He took my hand.  
"Jack, where's Fox?" Every word hurt.  
"He had some of "his boys" outside the house to back him up. I guess he
figured he was in trouble and called them in. I'm sorry, he got away. But you
damaged him pretty good." I managed a smile.  
"What time is it?"  
"It's about eight in the morning." I tried to sit up, but pain went shooting
up and down my entire body.  
"Ah!" I cried out in pain. Jack helped me sit up, a look of concern in his
eyes. "Kiss me." I whispered, his eyes meeting mine. He leaned forward, but
stopped.  
"I can't."  
"Why?" He looked at me for a minute. "You like Tiff, don't you?" I said.  
"No," He said. "I don't."  
"What?"  
"I was trying to get over you."  
"So it worked?"  
"No, but Boone makes you happy. And that's what I want."  
"Jack...Boone isn't here right now. He really doesn't care about me."  
"Yes, he does." He's going to get stuff for you. Hey!" he said. "You haven't
forgotten anything in awhile." I smiled.  
"Remember that night when you talking to Boone about what the doctor said
about my condition?"  
"Yeah..." he tilted his head.  
"I swore to myself that I would be okay again, so no one felt they had to give
up their life for me."  
"Okay..." He smiled guiltily.  
"What did you do?" I demanded.  
"I embellished."  
"What?"  
"I wanted to make sure Boone was going to be totally devoted to you."  
"Jack..." I breathed. His eyes met mine, my breath was taken away. "kiss me."
I said again. He leaned in again, but this time, he didn't stop.  
  
Boone came in about a half an hour later. He helped me to the bathroom. I took
a shower and got dressed, though it hurt really badly. Tiff and Jack were
laughing again, which still gave me a pang of jealousy in the pit of my
stomach.  
"Fox won't be back for a while." Boone said, as he folded a pair of jeans and
put them in his bag.  
"I'll find him, then."  
"No!"  
"What? You don't think I can handle him?"  
"I just don't want you to get hurt."  
"That's my choice."  
"So...you have absolutely no regard for people who love you?"  
"No...no regard." I said with a smile.  
"Figures." We were sitting in the room he and Jack were sharing. "How long are
we staying?" he asked.  
"Tiff said she can accommodate us until I get my family back." I said.  
"Maybe longer!" Tiff said as she came bustling in the room. "Jack's a real
catch, you know?" She giggled, grabbing something out of Jack's bag. "Got it!"
she called as she walked out of the room. I looked at Boone and smiled.  
"There you go." I said.  
"I'll give you a week. Then, after that...we're going to get Fox." Boone
looked at me, his eyes looking into my soul. I felt like he could read right
into my heart. I looked away. "Holly. I want to marry you."  
"What?" I almost jumped out of my skin.  
"When you're old enough."  
"In one year?" I was twenty three. My mother had always told me I should get
married between twenty four and twenty six. That's what I intended to do.  
"Yes."  
"Boone, I..."  
"Will you marry me?"  
"Boone...I...yes!" I smiled. He hugged me and spun me around. I didn't even
mind the pain from my wound.  
  
  
"Let's go." I said, motioning all of my friends and my boyfriend to move out.
We were going right from Fox. The Mickey mouse himself. The coward. My half-
brother. Tiff and I were going in after the boys. We were outside a warehouse;
it seemed to be a trend Mick liked. Jack's shoulder was almost completely
healed and my wound didn't hurt nearly as much anymore. Boone kicked open the
door. We all had our guns drawn. No one was there.  
"He's here." I whispered. "I know he is. He's been waiting for us."  
"You know me too well Holly." His voice bounced around the room. It came from
no where, yet it came from every where. "Attack!" Men came rushing at us, the
boys took two at a time. Tiff and I took one each; it was easy bringing him
down. My concern lay on Mick...and Mick only. I ran around looking every
where. Then it occurred to me, the roof. He was there I could almost feel his
presence up there. I ran up to the roof, kicking the door in. He was standing
there, with each member of my family at the edge, tied and bound up. He
leveled a gun at my head.  
"You take one step and I'll push them off one by one."  
"NO!" I screamed.  
"Don't be distracted!" Tiff said as she ran right to Fox.  
"What? Tiff?"  
"Mick and I are in love, sorry Holly." She said, tilting her head.  
"I told you to stop her!" Mick addressed Tiff.  
"She was gone...I'm sorry baby."  
"Now...here's the plan," Fox started again, "you watch me push them off one by
one anyways, and after...I shoot you! Okay! Sound good Fox! You're such a
genius!"  
"What...did one of you're imaginary friend tell you that, you psycho!" I saw
anger flash in his face. But it wasn't anything compared to the malice that
was boiling inside of me. "Come on you coward! You want to kill me? KILL ME!
COWARD!" I screamed. He clenched his teeth. He threw away the gun and lunged
at me, I sidestepped him once he got close enough. He reached out at the last
moment and grabbed me, we both went hurtling over the edge. Everything seemed
to move more slow. His triumphant laughter echoed in my head. I couldn't let
him win. But the five story drop tempted to prove otherwise. He was going to
bring me down with him. NO! He kidnapped my family, shot me in the chest, made
me lose Jack, and stole my grand-mother's bracelet. I saw a glimmer of hope in
the situation in about the seven second time span I had, I used him, kicking
off his body to propel myself into the building about two feet away and I went
crashing through the window. I lay on the ground thinking about what just
happened. I heard Fox's laughter turned to a scream of rage as it was still
echoing through the buildings, long after his demise. I ran down the stairs
and out into the alley. I ran back into the warehouse, but I came upon a sight
that made my stomach churn. Tiff was pointing a gun, right at Boone. Tears
were running down her face.  
"I loved him." She said, staring at me.  
"You were in love with a madman," I said, my voice shaking with rage.  
"NO! He was good!" She cried.  
"My brother was many things, but none of them were good." I replied
maliciously.  
"I'm not going to kill you, Holly. I want you to suffer, like I am. Mick knew
you'd come for him, so he set you up, to come with me. He came to Arizona
purposefully. Goodbye, Holly." She fired. Boone crumpled. I screamed. Another
gun fired. Jack's gun. She died instantly. Shame. I ran to Boone, tears
pouring down my face.  
"BOONE!" I screamed. He looked so peaceful and I hated it. I wanted him to
feel the pain. I wanted him to feel anything. I wanted him to marry me, to be
with me until death do us part. But for him, death did us part too soon.  
"Holly!" Jack cried, pulling me off Boone.  
"No! Boone!" GOD! "BOONE! Answer me! Answer me Boone Jonathon Sroth!"  
He didn't answer.  
  
  
He was buried in a graveyard, back home. I wouldn't know; I didn't go to his
funeral. I stayed with Gabe for awhile. He said he was appalled at what his
sister did and he never knew about it. Jack went home for the funeral. My
family was rescued and went home to fix up their place. About three months
went by after Boone's death. It seemed like every day it was going to be hard
to wake up. But eventually it got easier. I moved out, I couldn't stay in the
state. I went to Utah and bought an apartment. I dyed my highlighted my hair
more red and got a job at a dentist office. But no matter how hard I tried to
let go of the past, Boone haunted every moment's thought.  
Man, I really do love shoes. I thought as I walked out of a strip mall. I
walked towards my magenta Jeep Liberty. I pulled out my keys, but the momentum
of my pull had the keys sailing out of my hand on to the ground three feet in
front of me. I bent to pick them up, but someone had already bent to get them
for me. Jack. I smiled as I stood up and reached out for my keys. But I faced
a middle-aged stranger who was giving the keys. I nodded and went to unlock
the door. Stupid.  
"He doesn't quite pick up keys as well as I do." I spun around, Jack was
standing there. "I told you once; Holly, I love you and you are the only one I
will ever love. Holly, Baby. I will never forget you. I love you." He smiled
at me. "And I still mean it."  
"Jack! He was going to marry me!"  
"I know. You know what though? He wouldn't ever want you to be miserable."  
"Jack, please don't try to convince me to love you."  
"Your father told me once; you would've wanted that for me...when you were in
a coma. Did you want that? Did you? Did you want me to be miserable?"  
"No, I wanted you to find love. But listen, you don't have to convince me to
love you. I already do. We find ourselves together... I guess...we always
will."  
After my encounter with Jack, I went to the graveyard, I laid flowers down by
someone I didn't know. I don't know you I prayed, But tell Boone I say hi.
Does he want me to love another? No response. I turned, reluctantly and left.
A week went by with no response, then one day, a floral delivery man showed up
on my doorstep. He handed me a bouquet of flowers. In the card, there were two
words. It's okay. I'm quite sure there was a mix up in delivery. The card was
for a get well soon, yet I knew the flowers were mixed up and ended up on my
doorstep for a reason.  
  
Jack and I married about eight months later. We got married in the church I
grew up in, all the way in N.C. He looked handsome, and I, well I was told I
looked beautiful. Everything went smoothly. I found an UDCU base in Utah. Jack
moved in and we both decided to work there, it's where we were meant to be. We
went honeymooning in the Bahamas. Jack and I went on a cruise to the Bahamas
for five days, and from there we went to the Virgin Islands. We snorkeled and
met other honeymooners. The best part was that we could relax and not have to
worry about an attack nor a red alarm. Though, in a weird way, I started to
miss it by the end of the trip. I could tell that Jack felt the same way; I
could see it in his eyes. We hiked down trails and took a snorkeling trip on a
sailboat. We flew home from St. Thomas, Jack and I bought a small home in Utah
and unpacked our wedding presents. Then...it was time to go back to work.  
  
Apparently, all the UDCU headquarters over the country were basically set up
the same way; with all the different doors to all the different sub-units to
the force. I returned as an IF, Jack stayed as a Rush Force Commander. One
day, I walked into the force training room and I saw one of the younger
rushers flirting with Jack. He dodged her flirtatious hits and as kindly as he
could excused himself and started training other people. I realized right then
that I made a good choice to marry Jack and move on. I could've lost him. When
I we got home, I saw there was a message on our machine.  
"Hi, honey. We were all hoping you and Jack could move back up here and come
back to your father's base. Well, please call me back." My mother's voice was
kind of irritating yet I realized I missed them listening to her voice. Jack
must've seen agitation on my face because he said,  
"She loves and misses you. She only wants the best for you."  
"I know. I'll call later, after dinner." We had planned on going out to eat
with Jack's two siblings. As I walked upstairs, I sensed someone else was in
the room, my heart started to pound faster. A teenage boy, about seventeen was
sitting on our bed. He had dark hair, very cold, steel blue eyes, he had a lip
ring and looked like a punk. I didn't like him one bit. The expression on his
face was one of rage, one of anger.  
"Hello?" I asked, frowning. He said nothing. "What are you doing here?" Still
he said nothing. Jack was standing behind me. Jack spoke up.  
"Listen punk, answer my wife or get out of my house." I could tell by his tone
that Jack didn't like the kid either.  
"You killed my father." His voice was deep, cold and dangerous. He was looking
right at me.  
"No..."  
"Yes. Mick was my father."  
"You're too old, he was too young."  
"Mick took me in when I was a toddler. He raised me to call him father. That's
what he was to me. Now, he's dead." He sneered.  
"Mick was a bad guy. He would've traded your life for his, kid." I said,
equally coolly.  
"I would've let him." I was confused, he knew Mick was a bad guy, yet he still
loved him. Then I realized, Mick was the only person who might've cared for
this kid. Sad. I thought. It was like he read my mind, "Don't pity me." He
mumbled.  
"You need pity." I said, softer then before. He pulled out a gun, but before
he had a chance to fire, the front door opened and closed. Jack's little
sister came in, she was living with J.R. who had recently moved nearby. Jack's
parents had died when he was younger in a car accident. Her name was Francesca
though we called her Franny. She looked nothing like her brothers, long blond
hair, green eyes, tall and tan, she looked like a model.  
"Jack!" She cried, we were wondering if you're ready yet!" She yelled, running
up the stairs.  
"Don't come in here!" Jack cried, but it was too late. She froze once she
spotted the gun. The kid stared at her for a little while, but, amazingly
dropped the gun. They started at each other for a few seconds.  
"Okay..." I said, frowning. "What's going on here?" I demanded.  
"I know him." She said softly. "Greg...right?"  
"Yeah."  
"He goes to my school," She explained.  
"You're related to him?" Greg asked, pointing at Jack.  
"Yeah...I'm his sister." She admitted.  
"I'm calling the police." Jack said.  
"No!" The protest didn't come from Greg, but from Franny.  
"Fran?" I asked. "Why not?"  
"He's a good guy." She said.  
"Not...he's just like Fox. He's not good." I said angrily.  
"But he's just a teen, like me." She whispered. "What'll become of his
future?" She sure had Jack's fighting will, though.  
"His future is better in jail. He'll get himself killed if he isn't locked up,
like his father should've been." I growled.  
"He's different. He can change!" She cried.  
"Fran." Jack cut in. "Please tell me you're smarter than that. He's a killer.
He was doomed to be a killer for the rest of his life when he met Fox... and
nothing more." Jack's voice was cold, resenting. I could tell Fran didn't like
it when Jack was angry. I didn't know one person who wasn't scared when Jack
was angry. He even made me a bit nervous. "Get out." Jack said, trying hard to
keep his temper under control. "GET out!" he yelled. Greg ran past us, Fran
ran after him. The front door closed. I turned to face Jack.  
"Honey..." I said, put my arms around his waist. He avoided eye contact. "Are
you okay now?" I asked. He slightly nodded. I kissed him. "How about now?"  
"Better." He replied with a small smile.  
  
The next day, I found Greg. I hated where I found him, though. In J.R.'s
apartment.  
"What are you doing here?"  
"Fran invited me."  
"To live here."  
"I ain't got no other place to live." He spoke with resentment still on his
voice.  
"No." I said.  
"What'd you mean no?" His eyes narrowed.  
"I mean exactly what I said." I lowered my voice, threateningly.  
"Where'm I supposed to go?" He frowned.  
"That's not my problem." I said.  
"It is now." I turned around.  
"Fine." I squinted at him.  
  
  
  
"Now...you're not going to like this...but at my lunch break I went to your
brother's house and..."  
"What are you doing here?" Jack cut me off, seeing Greg lounging in the
kitchen.  
"Just listen." I said. "Please." He looked at me, and sunk into a chair.  
"He was at J.R.'s and I don't think J.R. or Fran are old enough to support
another person. It's just temporary, he's going to find a job and go to the
school here. He's going to stay in the room down here. The guest room." Jack
sat in silence for a few minutes.  
"Fine." He got up and went upstairs. I smiled and shrugged at Greg. He just
stared back. I nodded at him and went upstairs. For the next month, things
fell into place. I came home earlier than Jack. Greg and I didn't talk for
about the first week. But in time, both of our guards came down and we talked
regularly. We bonded. Jack, on the other hand, still didn't talk to Greg, no
matter how hard Greg tried. Greg was still a little angry at me from time to
time, but when I told him about what Fox did to me, he seemed to realize that
ripping someone's life apart wasn't good. And he realized he didn't want to be
like his father, he didn't want to be surrounded by people who would kill him
any time they wanted, people with no morals.  
  
"Jack, please just talk to the boy."  
"Your faith is misplaced." He said, stubbornly.  
"He needs an older male."  
"No...he needs to be shot."  
"JACK!" I cried. "DON"T EVER SAY-" we looked over and saw Greg at our bedroom
door.  
"What did I tell you, you little punk? Stay out of our room!" Jack said
angrily, walking towards him.  
"Jack! No!" I yelled, throwing myself in front of Greg. He looked at me for a
second, then pushed me out of the way. "Jack!" I screeched.  
"This kid is nothing but trouble." Jack said calmly. "He needs to be taught a
lesson." He grabbed him by the arm. Greg made no protest. I ran after him.  
"Please let him go!" I pleaded. He ignored me. I had to take action. I pushed
Jack, into the hall closet. He let go of Greg and back-handed me. My cheek
stung for a second, but I had been hit a lot worse. I was surprised. Greg
curled his hand into a fist.  
"Greg." I said quietly. "Please go to your room." He obeyed. I looked at Jack.
He looked terrified at what he had done. He looked nauseous.  
"Jack...you didn't mean to"  
"I hit you." He cut in. "I always thought I loved you more than anyone. But I
just hit you."  
"Jack, you know me...I've been hit a lot harder."  
"I hit you. It's just the fact that bothers me." I kissed him. "Jack, you were
angry...and rightfully so...but please don't take it out on the kid. He's not
Fox." Thus, started the relationship of Greg and Jack. They started talking,
doing manly stuff together. Jack swore to never hit me again, ever. I knew he
was telling the truth.  
  
Monday morning Jack and I walked into headquarters, we said bye and I walked
to the Commander's office. Commander Neff. He handed me a manila folder, as
usual.  
"This one's going to take some work." He said.

"When do I first infiltrate?" I asked.  
"Tonight. Eight o'clock...sharp."  
  
  
I stayed at headquarters until eight. I arrived at the club on time, under
cover. I looked the mob part. Expensive dress, I knew what I had to do. I had
to get him to like me. Like me a lot...after that I was in. After an hour or
so of different guys hitting on me, I spotted my intended target. I walked
over, but instead of talking to him, I walked right by...without so much as a
glance. Being in the unit for the number of years I had, I knew s a thing or
two about men with big egos. They feel the need for what they want when they
wanted it. He wanted my attention...I knew he was going to demand it. In, five
four, three, two,  
"Hi, there sweets." I spun around, and faced an Italian middle-aged man,
uncharacteristically good-looking for a mob boss. He winked at me.  
"You Manny?" I asked.  
"Yeah."  
"Meet me tomorrow at the café down the street at two o'clock. I've heard some
interesting things about you."  
"Then you should know I don't go into public much, for nobody."  
"Ooh...please?" I dropped my voice and leaned closer, sticking my bottom lip
out slightly.  
"Okay. Just this once." He said, giving into my femininity. I smiled and
walked out.  
"Finally," I hissed into my ear piece.  
"Way to go, girl!" Currie's voice in my ear.  
"Oh yeah...yay me. I got a date with a mob boss! How exciting."  
"Is he cute?" She mocked.  
  
I walked into my house. Jack had called me to tell that he had left the office
only a few minutes before me. He was already home. But everything was silent,
unusual.  
"Greg?" I yelled. "Jack!" I walked in Greg's room, stunned at what I saw. Greg
was standing over a man's body, a pistol in his hand. Jack was staring at
Greg. I had hard time breathing. "Greg." I groaned. "What did you do?" He
didn't look at me.  
"I told you!" Jack yelled. "I told you he was bad! He could never change!"  
"Is this true?" I asked Greg.  
"He attacked me. I killed him out of self defense." Greg insisted.  
"No." Jack said. "He didn't. I saw Greg bring the guy in here, so I followed
them. Greg kept demanding for something...and then I heard a gun shot."  
"I can't deal with this." I turned and started to walk away but I heard Greg's
voice.  
"Mom...please don't go." My heart almost stopped. He had called me Mom. Mom.
He seemed to not notice as he continued. "It was self defense. Please believe
me." I heard sirens outside. Greg's eyes were pleading.  
"I'm going to testify against you." Jack said, glaring at Greg. I almost
didn't notice the cops come swarming in. The saw the scene, and went over to
Greg, handcuffs ready. I ran to Greg and hugged him.  
"Leave him alone!" I yelled.  
"Ma'am please let go of the boy." An officer said.  
"He didn't do anything!" I cried. "It was me!" I said out of desperation.  
"No." Greg said weakly. "It was me. You can check the prints on the gun if you
want."  
"No!" I cried. They pried us apart.  
"This your son?" The officer asked me. Greg looked down at the floor.  
"Yes." I responded. "This is my son." I saw Jack's expression out of the
corner of my eye. But, I didn't care.  
  
"You protected him. Why?" Jack asked later that night when we were going to
bed.  
"He's good. I know he is."  
"Do you really want a child that badly?"  
"What?"  
"All a kid has to do is call you Mom and you'll protect them forever. Like a
dog and a bone." Jack's tone had turned cold.  
"Jack." I spat. "I saw the expression in his eyes. You were too busy having a
rage black-out." He clenched his teeth. "What do you have against Fox
anyways?"  
"He's a killer."  
"We've met plenty."  
"And they've all died. But none have left twisted little clones."  
"Jack!" I cried, appalled. "You're cruel."  
"Only to killers... They deserve cruelty."  
"Not their children!"  
"They're killers, too." I shook my head.  
"You're wrong."  
"Yeah...cause he proved me so wrong." He said, referring to Greg.  
"I will."  
"I dare you." I felt distanced from Jack at that moment, he probably felt it
too because he came over to me, a mysterious look in his eye. I loved that
look. "But for now...prove me wrong about something else."  
"What's that?" He kissed me and smiled.  
"That you love me more than that mob boss."  
  
The next day, I put on stilettos, a tight skirt and corset type shirt with
jacket. I looked like I belonged in the mob. I put on sun glasses and grabbed
my purse. I met with Manny at the café, we engaged in discussion and he told
me about his work. He went up to the cashier and bought our coffee. I guess it
was my ensemble, but he was very open about being a mob boss. He brought
someone with him, though. A woman. Her name was Melinda, she was his sister.
Melinda looked familiar, but she seemed like a normal mobster so I dismissed
it. Nonetheless, he invited me in and I politely accepted his invitation.  
"Okay, it's settled. I'll meet you tomorrow at six in the alley off of
fourth." I agreed.  
  
I walked in the door back at home, and heard Jack in the kitchen. He was
fishing around through the drawers.  
"Jack?" He looked up, a surprised look on his face. A guilty look flashed
across his face. "What're you doing?"  
"Making dinner." He smiled, I smelled something burning.  
"Jack!" I giggled. He ran over to me and picked me up, spinning me around. I
kissed him, still giggling in between the short kisses. He put me down, and we
ate burnt hamburger helper.  
  
I woke up in a rush.  
"Jack!" I whispered. He groaned and rolled over. I remember! I left my camera
on record from a crime scene on the desk! Maybe it recorded what actually
happened. I ran downstairs, leaving Jack in the bed, dazed and confused. I ran
over to the camera, which battery was dead. Plugging it in, I was anxious and
jumpy. I watched what last happened. I saw Greg throw a man into the room. The
man was begging and pleading, yet Greg looked pleasantly happy. He held up a
gun and, turning his head, fired the gun and killed the man. He lied. Greg was
smiling on the tape, when I turned from it. Jack was right.  
"What's wrong, honey?" Jack was standing right behind me.  
"You were right." I managed to choke out before turning and running up the
stairs. A funny sensation came over my body, like my mind was drifting from my
body. But soon I came back.  
  
It happened on and off through out the day, and I was contemplating not going
to meet Manny. But in the end, I decided work won over my discomfort. Walking
to the back alley, I felt woozy and almost high. What's wrong with me? I saw
Manny standing outside the warehouse, he smiled when he saw me.  
"How are you tonight?" My lips wouldn't move.  
"Say Something!" Currie whispered in my ear. Currie was stationed in a nearby
van. I tried again, but nothing. It seemed I had no control of my body. I
groaned.  
"Good!" Manny said "Then my drugs are working just fine." The coffee! I heard
a struggle inside my ear phone. I heard Currie scream, my eyes went wide with
fright. They were the only things I still had control over.  
"Hey. Manny speaking." A woman's voice came into my ear. Manny? "Ohhh, sorry
love, you don't know me." She quietly cackled. My mind was reeling. "Alright,
so here's the deal. I'll tell you everything because I'm going to assume
you're going to die, but then you mi
