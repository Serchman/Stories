**** Intro:** The outline and level-by-level description of a video/computer game based on the 9/11 attacks and their immediate aftermath. All levels are based on real events and true stories.

**100 DAYS**

100 Days would be a video/computer game taking place between September 11,
2001 and December 19, 2001, essentially, 9/11 plus the first 99 days of its
aftermath. The player would control ten diverse characters throughout ten
separate missions based on real life scenarios encountered by people during
the various disasters and tribulations of those 100 days. There would be three
difficulty settings, sheep, citizen, and hero. As the difficulty is turned up
more objectives are added, the characters take more damage from hazards,
enemies require more punishment to neutralize, ammunition becomes scarce, the
time allotted for missions is shortened, and more enemies and hazards are
added to the level. The game would be played primarily in the third person
view, with the option to switch between third and first person views.
Completion of missions would be ranked on a scale taking into account
difficulty, speed, damage taken, accuracy, enemies dispatched, and bonus
objectives completed. Also, uniquely, the “skin” of the character for each
level will change every time the player does the mission, encompassing all
genders and ethnicities, thus both diversity and replay value is assured.
Bonus missions are available and could be unlocked by beating the game on
"citizen" and "hero" difficulty settings.
