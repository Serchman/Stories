**** Intro:** Liam and Eddie from "The Buy", The early days 

* * *

New York usually has one bad snow storm a year and this one was a pisser.
Strong howling gusts of wind plastered thick heavy flakes against Grogan’s
plate glass windows. Now it’s impossible to exaggerate the pleasure I felt
comfortably riding out the storm in the taverns’ warm, cozy confines, enjoying
an early morning beer with a few comrades. We were sitting about exaggerating
the effects of storms past when the door blew open and in bursts ‘Dapper Dan’
himself, the ‘White Guinea’, AKA Bob Schaefer. He struggled to push the door
shut behind him, brushed himself off and scanned the room until he spotted me.
He nodded to a back table and I went to join him.

“A beer” I ask.

“Nah, I gotta get back to the wife and kids. Vinnie wants me to tell you to
meet him at Murkowski’s at seven tonight. He said you knew where it was.”

“Murkowski’s!” I damn near screamed at him “Murkowski’s in Maspeth! In this
weather? Is he out of his fucking mind! Why in Christ’s name does he want me
to go way the fuck over there to meet him in some god damn Polack bar!”

“How the hell do I know! Why the fuck did he drag me out of the house in a
fucking snowstorm to tell you something he could of with a simple fucking
phone call! Why the fuck do these crazy assholes do half the shit they do!”
The usually cool Bob was obviously feeling out of sorts.

  
The storm had blown over by the time I slowly worked my way through the
virtually shut down city arriving at Murkowski’s five minutes late. Vinnie was
waiting for me in the back room nursing a whiskey.

"You wanna drink?”  
"Yeah, I'll get it.  
I yelled out at Lou the bartender for a draught.

Vinnie was a tall, portly middle aged man and a friend of sorts. He was the
neighborhood Bookie when I was a growing up, and something of a folk hero to
all of us kids. For some reason he took a liking to me and I’d often run
errands for him. He offered me a job when I got out of high school but at that
level it would have been just a nine to five grind. Like working for IBM. And
not being a Dago I’d never go far.

He had since become a made man, moved up in the Genovese organization and was
now in charge of gambling. Or at least some of the gambling. It’s hard to know
what’s going on with these guys. But for old time’s sakes he still enjoyed
personally handling my action.

  
“What’s up?” I asked.  
"That was nice work with the jig"  
"Thanks"  
"You were real cool"

Eddie and I had organized the Marijuana trade in a large swath of Northern
Queens. It wasn’t difficult. The situation had been chaotic and the dealers,
police and politicians all welcomed the establishment of a calm orderly
market. But there’s always an asshole who won't listen to reason. In this case
it had been this big nigger. This really big nigger from the Islands. I had to
deal with the fucker personally  
The beer arrived and we were quiet until the bartender left.  
"I want you to do me a favor."  
"Sure."  
He passed over three pictures to me. An ugly bastard. Out sized square head,
deeply lined, sullen staring eyes, sour snarling lips.  
"This is Paulie Gagliano. I want you to take him out."  
"What!"  
"You heard me, I want you to take him out."  
"For Christ’s sake I'm not a hit man!"  
"You did pretty good acing that spade."  
"That was one guy, one time. I'm not interested"  
"I'll pay you whatever you want."  
"Doesn't matter. I’m not gonna do it"  
"From what I heard, it looked like you were enjoying yourself."  
I was, but it didn't matter.  
"Vinnie I'm just not gonna to do it. For Christ’s sake, you must have an army
of hit men."  
"Never met one that I know of. Never had to get involved with that shit."  
"Someone in your organization must have."  
"That's my problem Liam. Let me lay it out for you. This little cocksucker
raped my God Daughter."  
"Christ, I'm sorry Vinnie"  
"He said it was consensual. That she was just pissed at him 'cause he split
with her. She said there was nothing to split. The fucker was hitting on her,
but she couldn't stand the bastard. One night he came up to her apartment. She
let him in since after all he's Family."  
"I sorta figured."  
"Anyway, they got into a heated argument. He got pissed, pinned her down and
raped her. He's a strong bastard. Fucked her up the ass too. Well there was a
meeting about it. They decided it was a he said/ she said situation. And he's
the nephew of Sal Vincenzo, the family head in Brooklyn. He carries a lot of
weight. So nothing was done. I want this bastard dead. But I can't use anyone
who's connected. I’d hafta use some freelance guy, some drugged up asshole. I
can't have this traced back to me, or I'm a dead man."  
"Vinnie, what are you asking me? I'd be an amateur going against a hot dog
mobster. I wouldn't stand a chance."  
"Liam, he's not expecting anything. It shouldn't be a problem. Dress like a
tourist, stake him out, get a feel for his habits, then when he's alone, BANG"  
"You make it sound easy. You know where he lives, I assume”  
"No, and I can’t ask around or I’ll have people wondering. He’s working Vegas
now. He covers the strip clubs and gay bars. You hang around them, he'll turn
up."  
"I’m not hanging around any gay bars"  
He shrugged .  
"Liam, I need this favor. It's very important to me. You understand why."

So far the Mob had not taken official notice of our operation. I knew that
situation couldn’t last and I sure as hell would need a friend on the inside.  
"Shit! Off the top of my head, I'll need two guns, one with a silencer. Also a
phony driver’s license from some other state and a credit card. Pull that
together for me, and I'll see what I can do."  
"Liam, there will be too many questions asked if I did that. You'll have to
get it yourself. You know where to get guns, you should know who's making up
those phony drivers licenses for the underage kids. You won't need a credit
card. You can use cash. They’re use to it in Vegas. I'll give you thirty up
front for expenses, and you can keep the change. That sound OK to you "  
"OK with the expense money. But I'll return what’s left, assuming I survive
this. I want you to owe me. Big Time! Speaking of which, if I get killed or
arrested they’ll still be able to trace me back to New York, despite the phony
ID."  
"I know, and I could be toast. Some things though you just have to do. Thanks
Liam. And I don’t want ya tell anyone, including your asshole buddy, Eddie."

I didn’t answer.

“Liam, I don’t want ANYONE to know!” He was glaring at me.

“OK! OK!“  
  
I had to travel to rural Virginia for the guns. The local suppliers were too
unreliable. The mob knew everyone of them. I got another Glock .45 automatic,
a sound suppressor, and a .357 Magnum revolver.  
The kid doing the drivers license held me up for $200. He said he never did
Pennsylvania before, and had to do some research. He had an Aunt who lived in
Pittsburgh, so he gave me an address a couple of doors down from her. I chose
the name Steele, you know, steel and Pittsburgh. The first name I used was
Richard. In other words Dick Steele, or ‘Steele, Dick.’ I thought it was funny
as hell.  
I went over the entire deal in detail with Eddie.  
I got a short haircut, went to Sears, bought a cheap suitcase, a couple of
polyester suits, some sport shirts and a pair of loafers. Then I bought a used
stripped down pickup (expense account) and headed for Pittsburgh.  
  
I stopped at a small town outside of Pittsburgh and found a travel agent’s
office. A pretty, plump blond Slavic woman in her thirties was alone at a
desk. I needed a gimmick to explain the lack of a credit card. I told her that
I had a very delicate situation. I was having an affair with this very wealthy
married Pittsburgh woman and we wanted to get away incognito to Las Vegas for
a short vacation. I said very wealthy, because if she thought working class
she might have thrown me out of her office. But we all know wealthy women are
sluts, right? So she accepted it. Also, why wouldn't her husband question her
about that long an absence? Well, wealthy people are weird, aren't they?  
I told her we'd be going under an assumed name and paying cash so that we
could avoid having to show any identification. I’d pay her the cash up front,
she would take care of the hotel. She quickly grasped the tax implications  
"I have a nice 10 day package at the Desert Inn.“ She whispered
conspiratorially. She went over all the details. I expressed rapt interest.  
"That sounds like exactly what we want. Except, and this is really
embarrassing. I'm terrified of flying."  
"Oh, you shouldn't be embarrassed. Many people won't fly. I can put you on a
sleeper. When, would you like to leave?"  
"Tomorrow. This opportunity came up unexpectedly for us."  
I paid her cash for the two round trip train tickets, got a piece of paper
confirming the 10 day paid package for Ronald Reagan for 2 people, drove the
pickup to the airport, parked in long term parking then took a cab down town.
I treated myself to the Hilton. Ah the expense account life! Christ it was
expensive. I didn't see where it was worth it.  
After checking in I went down to the bar and had a couple of beers. A number
of business men, a few women, but not much going on. I went up to my room,
watched television for a while then went to sleep.  
  
I got up early my first morning in Vegas. It was too early to go to the clubs,
so I killed time, played a little $2.00 blackjack, which was available during
the day. I had to stay with the cheap tourist image. Sat around the sports
book, bet on some of the races at Calder. Not much, but all on the expense
account. Enjoyed the free beer being brought to me by the pretty babes with
their boob’s half hanging out. I went to the bar around 4 in the afternoon,
asked the bartender in a lisping voice where the gay bars were. I figured I'd
get the unpleasant stuff out of the way first. He wasn't taken back at all.
Gave me a list of bars and directions. Christ, I can't imagine what would have
happened if someone came into Grogan's and asked that. Would Donal, or whoever
was on duty, scream at him to get the fuck out? Would an unbelieving hush fall
over the bar, maybe a lot of snickering? Would one of the guys, maybe a
couple, take him outside and beat the shit out of him? One thing I'm sure of
is that he wouldn't have been given directions to any gay bar in a calm and
sophisticated manner.  
I went to four of the bars that night. Drank free all night. Even though I
assured them I wasn't, I was pegged as a cop. I never realized cops got this
many free beers. I may have missed my vocation. A few guys tried to strike up
conversations with me, but I blew them off. Bad terminology, BRUSHED them off,
which probably helped establish my identity as a cop.  
Well enough of that I thought. Now for the fun part. The next night, Friday, I
started a little later and went to two of the strip joints. I didn't use the
valet parking, but parked at the edge of the lot, where I could still see the
entranceway. I planned to go into the club and when I did spot him go out to
my car and wait, following him when he left. As it turned out I didn't have
much choice, the lots were full, the clubs packed, mostly groups of guys, a
couple of women. Not many loners like me. The girls were all different types,
all good looking. They circulated, hitting on the groups, dancing on tables. I
was two deep off the bar, and completely ignored. It was fun for a while, but
you can have too much of a good thing. By the end of the night I was
critiquing their dancing skills, and watching the antics of the customers.  
I tried a couple of new places the next night. The first was called “The
Diamond Club” The club was on the outskirts of town, and had a gigantic neon
sign. It sat alone among some scrub, just off the exit ramp from the
interstate. The club itself was set back at the edge of the property, with
valet parking on the right, and regular parking on the left. The parking lot
was enormous. Must have been close to 80 yards wide. It had a few very dull
floodlights around the perimeter.  
The lot was almost full. It was Saturday night and like last night the place
was crowded and boisterous. I struggled to get a beer over the crowd at the
bar. I was there about an hour, trying to think of another approach I could
use for this job, when a new stripper came out. She was dressed as a tiger
(The girls frequently used themes, nurse, school girl, evening gown, etc). She
had short dark red curly hair and a round pretty face with a thin nose that
stuck straight out. Not a pug nose, but not Pinocchio either. She had what
could be referred to as 'ample' breasts, gorgeous legs and a perfect butt. She
jumped around the stage growling at the customers, and then began her strip. I
was in love! Or at least extremely turned on.  
She circulated afterwards, but I couldn't get anywhere near her.  
I eventually went on to two other places.  
The next day I decided this approach was bullshit, but decided to play it out
to the end of my 10 day package then tell Vinnie he had to find a way to get
me the address.  
I went back to the Diamond Club first hoping to see the love of my life dance
again. It was Sunday, and the lot was virtually empty. There were a group of
cars in the back of the lot, probably employees. Not many cars otherwise. I
went in; there were half a dozen guys at the bar, and maybe four tables
occupied. I sat at the bar and watched the dancers. One was just finishing her
act, and another, a sophisticated looking blond in an evening gown started up.
With the sparse crowd the trollers were reduced to hitting on me. I turned
down two of them. Then SHE came out and went through her act. I sat
mesmerized. I went up and stuck a dollar in her garter.  
She finished her dance, and disappeared into the back. I wondered if she would
circulate, and in about 10 minutes there she was, still in her tiger outfit,
heading straight for me.  
" Buy me a drink?"  
" Sure"

She signaled the bartender. I don't know what the hell it was he brought her.  
"You’re an absolute knockout“ I said

“I noticed your tongue hanging out, and your popped eyes. And by Golly, you
gave me a whole dollar. My names Marci, What’s yours?"  
"Steele, Richard Steele. Or 'Dick of Steel' as the ladies like to say." I
chuckled. I still liked that one. She just looked at me, unbelieving." I’m
from Pittsburgh" I continued.  
"What brings you to Vegas? "  
"I'm on a 10 day junket with my girlfriend. She got pissed and split"  
"What happened "  
"She said I was too kinky in bed. Look, I'd love to see you. Can we get
together after you get off?”  
“No, I never go out with customers, it's against the rules"  
"Come on, never! "  
" Well" she laughed ”sometimes. But only if they are very, very cute”  
“Well?"  
I grinned at her  
“I don't think so. Suppose I dance for you."  
Anything you want honey, I thought.  
We went over to a table and a waitress brought me another beer and her
'drink'.  
She waited until the next set was about to begin then got on the table and
started her dance, beginning to strip, smiling down at me. Bliss!  
Suddenly a chill came over the room. I saw her look toward the door. She
looked scared. I turned. It was him. I felt the adrenalin surge. The game was
on.  
He was taller than I imagined, about 5 '11, lean but muscular, with
exceptionally broad shoulders. You couldn't miss that ugly outsized face. He
walked straight toward us but wasn’t looking at us. He came straight on like a
locomotive. When he was near our table he glanced at her briefly, snapped his
fingers, and thrust his index finger toward a back table, and continued his
march. She got down off my table “Sorry sport. I'll catch you later“ and went
over to join him.  
Another girl came up almost immediately and asked if I'd like her to dance for
me. I said yeah. I glanced over at Marci, she was chatting and laughing
nervously, frequently touching her hair like girls do when they’re edgy. He
just sat there looking at her sourly. The number ended, and I thanked my girl
and tipped her $10. She didn't seem overly appreciative. I saw Marci get up
and head for the dressing room. Her next set must be coming up soon. I
finished my beer and left. There were two car jockeys sitting just inside the
door. They glanced at me, I shook my head no.

I walked over to my car and slid down in my seat, still able to see the
entranceway. Now to wait. I got the bastard. I felt high.  
A half hour later the valet goes out and comes back with a big boat of a
Caddy. Marci and Paulie climb in. I have my keys in the ignition and I'm ready
to go. The caddy makes a wide circle, drives past me and parks toward the back
corner of the lot, near the employee’s cars. The nearby floodlight allows me
to see them dimly. He takes out a cigarette, she leans over and lights it for
him, blows out the match then disappears. He sits there quietly smoking. A few
minutes later she pops up and wipes her mouth. They talk for a few more
minutes, then she walks back to the club. OK I thought, here we go. But he
just sits there smoking. What the fuck’s he waiting for! I look around. No
one. Why don’t I do it right now fast, and get it over with. Risky, but I'm in
the zone. I screw on the silencer, wedge the .45 uncomfortably in my belt, get
out of the car, and stagger drunkenly toward to the edge of the lot near his
car, my suit jacket flapping open but still covering the gun. I stop and pee
(which I had to do anyway after all that beer) into the scrub, then turn
around. Still no one in sight. I act as though I just spotted him and stagger
over. I crouch down my hands on my knees, the fucking gun poking at me hard,
practically falling out. I peer in at him.

"Whatcha doin' just sitting there in the dark?"

I hear a muffled "Get the fuck out of here" and got a very menacing look

"Come on, let's get a little drinky" I slurred, doing a pantomime at the same
time. "

“I told you to get the fuck out of here" Turning purple.

I feigned losing my balance and sat down on my rear. I stood up laughing.
“come on, I'll buy ya a drink."  
Hell hath no fury I guess, as he opened the door and started out to teach me a
lesson. I went to slide the .45 free but it caught in my belt. He recognized
what was happening and reached for his own weapon, but was in an awkward
position halfway out of the car. Finally I got fucking thing loose and was
able to put two into his body then two in his head before he was able to draw.
Brains splattered all over the dashboard. I was sailing. I turned to go back
to my car and there is Marci, petrified, mouth open, eyes wide. Stupid!
Stupid! Stupid! I was so wound up in my play action I stopped watching. “Don’t
kill me“ she whimpered.

I knew I should kill her, but I couldn’t bring myself to.

”Give me your wallet!” I walked over to her "I need a few minutes to get out
of here, and you forget what I look like, or you ARE a dead woman.”  
  
"I won't. I know the score."

I went back to my car and drove out slowly straight to Hertz. After turning
the car in I got a replacement at Avis and drove back to the Desert Inn. I was
still high. I found a $5 black jack game and played for three hours, drinking
beer, slowly bringing myself down.
