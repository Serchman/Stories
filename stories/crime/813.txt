### Dang good story 1 by lifeisjust

Man, I love shoes! I thought as I dug in my purse for my keys. I was walking
out of the mall in my three inch heel new boots, another new bag hanging from
my arm. I spotted my blue Volkswagen Bug and finally found my keys.  
"Ah-HAH!" I said triumphantly, pulling them out. The momentum from my pull had
the keys sailing out of my hand, to land five feet away. An attractive man
with brown hair and a blue shirt picked them up. He had a clean cut jaw bone,
and a short, stubbly hair-like-beard. His eyes were brilliant green.  
"Thanks." I said, smiling at him. But, as I reached to take my keys back, he
grabbed my hand, and pulled me in so his lips were almost touching my ear.
Before I had a chance to yell or pull back, he spoke,  
"No problem, oh, and by the way, give him one of your mean high kicks." He
pulled back, nodded at me and left me dumbly standing there. I opened my
trunk,  
"Give who my what?" I pondered out loud. I was about to lift my bag into the
trunk when I felt something jabbed into my back, something hard and cold, like
metal. It was a gun.  
"Turn around slowly and give me your keys." The gruff voice made me choke on
my breath. I did as it bid. I saw a grisly, unshaven man standing behind me.
"Now get in." He motioned to the car.  
"HEY!" I heard someone yell. I had no time to look, but my captor did. It was
his only, fatal error. Give him one of your mean high kicks. The stranger's
voice echoed in my head. I did. I kicked him across the face and sent him
stumbling. He turned to hit me, but I wouldn't let him get one in. I gave him
my left uppercut and right jab. Just like I practiced. I gave him one final
kick that sent him sprawling, unconscious on the cement ground of the mall
parking lot. I looked over my shoulder and saw the man who had picked up my
keys. About five people were standing around, all going to their cars or going
to the mall when they had seen the event. He started to walk away.  
"Hey!" I yelled and ran after him. The people's gaze followed me, but
eventually went back to the crook on the ground. He stopped. "What's your
name?"  
"Jack." He said with a smile. I shook his hand. "And yourself?"  
"Holly"  
"Well Holly, pleasure meeting you." He turned to walk away.  
"Hey, wait a minute! How did you..." He spun to face me again, his eyes
piercing mine, yet, in a non-threatening way.  
"You wouldn't believe me if I told you."  
"Try me."  
"Famous clich√© words. So, here's how it will play out. I'll actually tell you
how I knew; you'll call me crazy and run away, screaming behind you that you
never want to see me again, no matter how many times I save your life."  
"You didn't save my life!"  
"Well, then, I'm sorry ghost girl." He turned again, but I grabbed his arm.  
"I would have kicked that guy."  
"Yeah, after he rape-"  
"Okay, I get it, thanks."  
He started to walk away.  
"Wait!" I said he spun around, again. "My turn." I turned and walked from him.  
  
  
"Holly, please...please wake up." it sounded like he was crying. "Holly, I
love you and you are the only one I will ever love. I'm sorry I couldn't save
you...I'm sorry."  
  
  
It started to rain. I hurried up to my apartment, letting myself in I ran over
to the phone message machine and pushed play. I tuned out the voice of my
mother and went over to check on Spot. Spot was my northern pine snake.  
"You hungry, boy?" I asked him, tossing in a frozen rat. My cat, Chuckles
lurked over as I opened a can of cat food for him, feeding him too.  
"Don't be alarmed." A deep voice said behind me. I jumped, my heart started
racing.  
"Who are you?" I demanded  
"Don't turn around."  
"Why not?" I heard a click, a click of an empty gun. "AHHHHHH!" I screamed,
"You just tried to kill me!" I heard the stranger reloading his gun. Seizing
the opportunity, I spun around, punching the gun out of his hand. He swung a
big fist at me, but I was faster and ducked. I punched him in the groin,
leaving him doubled over. I punched his jaw upward and kicked him in the face.
"Why can't you creeps just leave me alone?" I whined. My door burst open.
"Ahhh" I shrieked as another man came running in, just a blur to me. A gun
went off, then silence. I hid my face was in my hands, I was afraid to look.
When I did, I almost collapsed.  
"Jack!" I cried. "What are you doing here?"  
"Saving you again," He panted. I looked down to a spot his bloodied hand
covered.  
"Oh my- you're shot!"  
"I noticed." He winced.  
"How...I..."  
"He turned the gun on me as I was firing." I walked over and with a shaking
hand called 911.  
"Jack, you have a lot of explaining to do." I said "Why have all these guys
been attacking me? Why do you show up at the-...?"  
"Listen, I know things don't make sense right now, but they will. I promise."
He leaned on the desk for support. "Your dad...he works for an agency. UDCU."  
"English, please."  
"Un detected crime unit."  
"How on earth can crime be un detected?"  
"If the crime is on the D.L. un detected by the public"  
"You just said D.L." I said with a smile.  
"Listen, seriously. There are these cult members who have been attacking you.
They obviously want something from you. I know your dad, that's how I know
you. He taught you your defense moves."  
"So?"  
"That's how I knew about your high kicks... listen we want you on the force."  
"Wait a minute...two minutes ago I was a normal...victim of crime and now you
want me on some special force that hunts down crime the government doesn't
want exposed and what, you're mutants? And...hey, what do you mean we?"  
"Something like that. There's a whole force of us...including your father." He
said with a smile.  
"What?" I practically screamed. My vision was getting cloudy.  
"This force requires perfect genetic and health records. Haven't you noticed
pain isn't that bad for you?"  
"High pain tolerance?"  
"Way, high pain tolerance."  
"What do you guys fight?"  
"Sometimes...we don't even know."  
  
"Holly, it's mommy." She sounded tired. "We are so worried about you. Holly,
honey...I'm sorry about that thing...it felt like I couldn't stop...I think
Mick used drugs or someth-" I heard another voice in the back round.
"Oh...okay. The doctor said I had to leave...bye sweetheart...I love you."  
  
  
I sat at home, after going to the hospital with Jack and talking with my dad.
I was eating some oven-cooked pizza watching taped Days of our Lives episodes
when I heard whispering outside my door. I stormed over and opened it, taking
the trespassers by surprise.  
"What do you want from me?" I yelled, only to find two, twelve year old girls
outside my door.  
"Want some cookies?" One asked with a frown.  
"Oh...sorry...I thought you guys were...relatives." I said with a nervous
laugh. They looked at each other like I was a weirdo.  
"Yeah, suuuure. I'll take two boxes of thin mints. Guilty pleasure..." I added
with a laugh trying to redeem myself. It didn't help.  
  
What's wrong with you? I asked myself, closing the door and tearing into one
box of thin mints. I set it on my small wooden table. My apartment had three
rooms; a bedroom, with white plush carpet and pink bordered walls, a bathroom
branched off the bed room. I had a tiny kitchen, just big enough to cook
things in, a tiny dining room, with a slightly bigger table and a family room.
In the family room my table sat more towards the kitchen, with green worn
sofas five feet away. It was a living. I had two closets, one in my room and
one in the tiny five by five parlor I had when first walking in. (Kitchen to
the left and dining to the right. Farther down the hall were the family room
to the left and my bedroom to the right.)  
"I'll tell you what I want." A voice from the closet said, this time,
surprisingly female. A blond, five foot young woman jumped out. No weapons
were visible either. I punched her as soon as she jumped out, gave her a
"mean" high kick and punched in the stomach which made her gasp for air.  
"Your element of surprise is weakening." I said, "Cult girl." Nice touch. I
silently praised myself.  
"Give me...the bracelet."  
"Or you'll do what? Let me kick you again? Oh, no pl-..." She silenced me with
a punch. Blood trickled down my lip, but I couldn't feel any pain yet, just
anger. "Ohhhh, nuh-uh!" I said and went after her. I swung but she ducked. So,
I kneed her in the ribs. She coughed and sputtered for air.  
"Now," I said twisting her arm behind her back "Tell me why."  
"We need it, the worth...everyone wants it, dates back to..." She passed out.
I got dressed out of my pajamas, quickly into my clothes. When I came out of
my bathroom she was gone. I grabbed my purse, but accidentally knocked it
over, sent the contents sprawling. I saw a wrapped twenty first birthday
present half out, half in my purse. Surprise, surprise, it was my
grandmother's old bracelet. I ran out the door to pay Jack a little visit.  
"Listen, I have a cat and a snake at home, so I don't have time to do your
little mind trick blah blah, 'I think I won't make any sense deal'." Jack just
looked at me.  
"Really? Cause I think it's quite enjoyable and not-time consuming."  
"I don't care what you think."  
"Then why are you here?"  
"I want some questions answered."  
"And if I don't answer them?"  
"Oh, you will."  
"You gonna make me?"  
"If I have to."  
"What do you want to know?"  
"Where is this place, is this even a paying job, who is there and why don't I
know about it."  
"Sorry, nurse's orders, I'm not allowed to answer more than two questions in
less than one minute or..."  
"Haha, that's good. Okay, nurse boy, give them all."  
"All what?"  
"Answers. I'm not in a good mood; I just got attacked by a blond woman who
jumped out of my closet. Today hasn't been an ideal day."  
"Really, today's been great for me!"  
"Do you want a black eye to go with your already hurt pride?"  
"I can't answer your questions just yet. I'll show you as soon as I can."  
  
Walking out of Jack's room, I looked back and I saw a nurse go in.  
"Miss!" I called after her. She came back out.  
"Yes?"  
"Don't mind his black eye. He was cheating on me." I said sincerely.  
"What? This boy's going down." I smiled to myself as an angry nurse walked
into my newfound friend's room.  
  
"Listen honey, we can talk later, daddy's on the phone now."  
"And he still treats me like I child." I was walking out of my dad's study
room in my parent's million dollar mansion.  
"He'll come around." My mom said, taking my hand and facing me. "He's under a
lot of pressure."  
"Yeah, I know...but I am too!" I added. "Does he not understand that I know
what he does now and I'm going to do it too?"  
"Your father planned on having a son." My mom said looking at me. "When he
only got girls...I guess he didn't plan on..."  
"Plan on what?" I demanded.  
"Plan on not being able to let his "princesses" his baby girls, in on what he
does. It's gruesome work." I felt my stomach turn.  
"How do you know?"  
"I've practically been your father's psychiatrist for the past thirty years."  
"Do Patty and Bess know about this?"  
"NO, don't say anything to them." She hissed as they came upstairs to find us.  
"Ready to eat?" Patty asked.  
"Oh, my co-worker, Mr. Paler is coming too. Did you set a spot for him?"  
"Yes, father," Bess answered. The doorbell rang.  
"Please answer it, Holly." I ran downstairs and checked my reflection. I
brushed through my shoulder length strawberry blond hair and saw two different
color eyes staring back at me. Brown and green, it was the thing I was most
self-conscious about on my five foot, seven petite build. I was also slightly
pale, but got a nice tan in the summer. I had a white knee length skirt on and
a blue shirt. I was the youngest. I was the baby. I ran over to the door.  
"Mr. Pa-...you?" I asked, looking straight at Jack.  
"Hi!" He said cheerily, a bit too cheery. "Long time, no see. Meet my brother,
J.R." I shook the hand of a younger, extremely attractive young man. He had
brown/blondish hair with even more intense green eyes. I suddenly became self-
conscience of my two different colors. In grade school people called me an
alien because of it.  
"Hello, again." I said smiling a sarcastic smile at Jack. "Pleasure to meet
you, J.R. I'm Holly." I said meeting his gaze.  
"The pleasure is all mine." He said with a charming smile.  
"Please, come in." I showed them around and finally went outside with the rest
of my family. They had a brick deck/patio overlooking the North Carolina
Ocean. My parents had a nice patio set and the stereo was softly playing.
Everyone exchanged introductions and we started the meal.  
"So, Jack, tell me about your family." Patty gushed. Please someone, gag me
and knock me out with something...anything, hey even a freaking spoon would
work. I thought as Jack dove into a comical explanation of his family. The
family cat came over against my leg, his name was Buster.  
"You left today?" I asked suddenly cutting into his story.  
"Holly, don't interrupt people." My mom scolded.  
"No, that's perfectly fine." He said with a slightly sinister smile.  
"I see you've two met before." My sister Patty cut in again. My other sister
was talking to J.R.  
"I've had the pleasure." I said through clenched teeth.  
"Ahhhhh!" Jack yelled in surprise. "Something just bit me!" I noticed Buster
was no longer near my leg.  
"Holly, go help our guest, get him a band-aid." My dad said. I shook my head
in the most discreet way possible.  
"Patty isn't eating, she can do i-"  
"No, go." He cut me off.  
"Come right this way." I said in an overly sweet sing song voice to Jack. I
led him into the kitchen.  
"What are you doing here?" I hissed.  
"Your father invited me to supper." He replied sweetly.  
"So? If my father asks you to do anything, just say no."  
"Why?"  
"Because it usually involves me."  
"So, is that a problem?"  
"Yes!"  
"Why?" I looked up at him after giving him a band-aid.  
"Does your brother know?" I asked  
"Know?"  
"Yes, about what you do."  
"What we do...no. He doesn't."  
"Good."  
"Why?"  
"No reason."  
"I think your sister likes me."  
"I think she does too. Ask her on a date." I said bitterly.  
"You wouldn't have a problem with that?"  
"No... why would I?" I asked him, as he explained.  
"Because..." Patty walked in.  
"Are you two going to stay in here forever?" She asked, "Come on, Dad's
waiting." She let Jack go out first, before pulling me aside.  
"Do you like this guy?" She asked anxiously.  
"Jack?" I snorted. "No." and laughed a little.  
"Okay, good."  
"Go for it." I said. "He's not as charming as his brother." We walked back out
into the fading sunlight.  
"Boys..." My father said after everyone had eaten. "I hope you can come for
the party we're having tomorrow."  
"It'll be a blast." My mom said.  
"We'd be delighted." Jack answered.  
  
"Bye, Holly, baby. I will never forget you. I love you."  
  
When I got home, it was around ten o clock. Good thing I left dinner out for
Chuckles. I thought, noting he wasn't around, but his food bowl was empty. I
glanced at the phone and played a message. My best friend, Suzie had called.
We both worked at the dental office, the front desk. I also had an email
sitting open on my fifty year old, giant, cheap computer.  
Holly,  
We're going to come a little before the party to talk to you and your dad.
This job has many requirements. Some of which include quitting your current
job "No!" I said out loud. And yes, this job pays. Have you seen your father's
house? Even lawyers don't make that much.  
Jack  
I turned off the computer and crawled into bed.  
  
"Miss Grant?" I spun around.  
"Yes Rita?" Rita was my co worker.  
"A man is here to see you." I looked over at Suzie, who gave me the thumbs-up.
I walked through the back of the dental office towards the front. The office
had little star designs and was supposed to look like a sunset. Sunset Dental
Offices, that's what it was called, anyway. I walked up and saw a man, blond
hair, blue eyes, tan model-type looking.  
"How can I help you?" I asked with a smile.  
"My name's Mark Bradski, I'm a friend of your fathers." He said politely. I
shook his hand. "Can we go for a walk?"  
"Sure. Hold on," I walked over and told them I was taking a quick break. I
walked back out, and smiled. "Okay, ready." We walked outside where there was
a little strip mall, and sat on a bench. "Do you know Jack?" I asked.  
"Jack?"  
"Oh, good. Sorry, never mind."  
"Okay."  
"Are you in a cult?" He looked at me like I was crazy.  
"No."  
"So...was there a reason you came?"  
"Yes, your father hired me...as your bodyguard."  
  
  
I slammed the newspaper my father was reading down on the desk. My mother was
at the door.  
"I tried to stop her." She said, wiping her hands on her apron. She turned
around and left.  
"Is there a problem?" I was outraged, my father hired someone to guard me
because I wasn't good enough myself or something, and he was asking if there
was a problem!  
"No, I slammed the newspaper down on the desk 'cause I want to read it." I
spat sarcastically.  
"Don't talk to me like that young lady." He scolded.  
"Dad, I am an adult, why are you sending someone to guard me."  
"Honey, I listen to my advisor, my good friend Jack. He said it would be a
good idea..."  
"I should've known." I said, squinting. Of course he would, Jack is behind
everything! "Okay, thanks." I said, smiling and headed for the door.  
"Honey," I turned. "Don't be too hard on him." He said.  
"I can't guarantee anything."  
  
  
"You!" I said, catching up with Jack at the gym. I had to call his brother,
who told me he had gone to a country club to golf. I went, from there they
told me he had gone to the gym; that he had mentioned it on the way out. Jack
looked up, no surprise showing on his face.  
"I was expecting you."  
"Yeah...right. Next time don't yell where you're going over your shoulder."  
"Why do you think I did it this time?"  
"You knew I'd come looking!"  
"Hey, I know you better than you think. "  
"That's creepy."  
"I knew you wouldn't be able to take a bodyguard sitting down, you'd put up a
fight."  
"Fine, I'll prove you wrong. I won't fight you. HA!"  
"You got me there, don't fight." He said with a grin.  
"Hey! Wait a minute...you'd just say that so I'd...Argh!" I said, spun around
and walked out of the gym. Something came out of the bushes while I walked to
my car. Stay calm...now, attack! I spun around punching my offender in the
face while kicking him in the stomach. He fell without getting a single hit
in. I looked down and saw Mark on the ground.  
"Oh my gosh! I'm so sorry!" I said bending down to help him up. "Is that
really necessary?"  
"I guess not." He said, grimacing in pain as I helped him up.  
"Are you okay?"  
"The only thing hurt is my dignity."  
"Again, I'm so sorry."  
"Listen, I guess I don't need to defend you, but I do need a date to dinner
tonight. Would you accompany me?"  
"I'd love to." I smiled. "Oh! I'm sorry...I can't. I forgot about this party I
have to go to...hey, do you want to come with me?" I asked enthusiastically.  
"It'd be my pleasure." He replied. "What should I wear?"  
"Wear something...well, nice."  
  
I ran home, after giving Mark directions to my parent's house. I held up two
dress options for Spot. He blinked at me from behind the cage and flicked his
tongue to the dress I was holding on the right.  
"Yeah... I think so too." I responded, slipping it on. It was a black dress
with a beaded empire waistline. I put on gold bands and gold earrings.  
  
"You're ten minutes late." My dad said to me as I ran in the door.  
"Nice to see you too." I huffed.  
"How many times do I-"  
"Honey," My mom said cutting off my dad "we have guests waiting."  
I walked in and saw Jack with another man. Jack smiled at me and for a moment
my breath caught in my throat. He looks good.  
"Holly, this is the agent of arms, Gabe Wilson."  
"Gabe...nice to meet you." I said shaking his hand,  
"For someone of your beauty I think you should be working someplace cleaner."
He said, his brilliant brown eyes meeting mine.  
"Thank you." I said, blushing slightly.  
Jack cut in "well, now we've all met..." He dove into my work requirements and
what force they wanted me on. "We want you on the rush force."  
"Rush force?"  
"The back up forces...from there you may be promoted."  
"To what?"  
"To an acd"  
"An acd?"  
"Yeah, an agent a cop and detective all in one."  
"Cool."  
"Warning...they're hard to achieve."  
"Consider me warned."  
  
During the course of the party I met more people on the team. That's including
Melissa Ryan, acd; Nick Carlinos, rush force officer and Fern Nelson,
commander of acd.  
"This party is crawling with members." I whispered to Jack after bumping into
him in the hallway.  
"I know...you father is the one to accredit this time." He replied with a
wink. "Now, I need to get back to my date."  
"Your date?" I snorted.  
"Your sister." He laughed, slipping down the hall before I could smack him.
The doorbell rang. I ran to answer it. Bess got there before.  
"And who are you?" She asked raising her eyebrows.  
"Mark Bradski, my date." I answered bumping in front of her. I nearly choked
on my tongue when I saw him. He was dressed in a tux, like most others at the
party. But his blue eyes were shining in the light the chandelier was
producing. "Please come in."  
"Who are you?" I spun around. Jack was quizzically looking at Mark.  
"My date." I answered. I took Mark by the hand and led him past Jack who
stood, rooted to the spot staring as we walked down the hall. A few more
people asked who he was and I introduced him to my parents.  
"Want to dance?" He asked  
"Sure." No one else was dancing; most were talking, so when he led me out in
to the middle of the back porch people watched. Classical music was playing.
He pulled me in close so I could smell his cologne. Others started joining in.
I looked over his shoulder and saw Jack, who winked at me. I stuck my tongue
out at him, than smiled. How mature. He mouthed.  
  
"Bye mom," I said hugging my parents goodbye. Mark, Jack and I were they only
ones left.  
"Can I drive you home?" Mark asked.  
"Sure," I said, (even though my car was here, I'd take a bus to get back here
in the morning.) We walked out to his car. On the way home we talked about the
party, my parents, my life, and his life...the usual. I was disappointed when
we stopped in front of my apartment building.  
"Bye." I whispered. I leaned over to kiss him on the cheek, but he turned his
head and his lips met mine. My breathing slowed as we hung for a moment. The
world stopped for a second.  
"Wow," he whispered. "Goodnight. I'll call you."  
"Goodnight," I said, biting my lip.  
  
I danced into my apartment and fed my animals. I fell asleep on the couch, and
woke up to knocking. I noticed I had fallen asleep in my clothes, makeup
smudged. I ran to the mirror and fixed some of it.  
"Hello, hello." Jack said, after I had opened the door.  
"Oh, it's you."  
"You got that right. Please though, tone down the enthusiasm." He smiled, my
stomach turned just a little. He is cute...no! He's Jack...JACK!  
"Oh, sorry, my bad. Come in." I joked.  
"Thanks." He looked around. "Nice place,"  
"You've seen it before, Jack."  
"Want something to drink?"  
"Whiskey...fine, coffee." He corrected after I gave him my yeah-um-no, look. I
poured him some. "Came to drive you to your first day...I noticed you left
your car at your parents house. Have fun with Mark?" He asked resentfully.  
"Yes, thank you, lots." I replied smartly.  
"He kiss you?" He asked.  
"Maybe." He looked at me, as if studying my face. A slight frown on his brow,  
"I don't like him." He murmured  
"He's nice." We stood in silence for a minute and I excused myself to change.
When I walked back out Jack looked up at me.  
"Come on, let's go." He said brusquely and walked out.  
  
The drive there was silent.  
  
I walked into a circular white room with many doors on it. The front door was
in an alley off the harbor close to my parents' house. Each door has a pad on
the right side, a security system.  
"The code is 4592." Jack said walking to the door to the right of the center
one. He pressed it and walked in. We came into a hall with another door at the
end. "Each door is for the level of the agent...this, is rush force."  
"I never asked you, what are you?" I turned toward him.  
"I'm a commander of rush forces, you'll be taking orders from me."  
"Oh goody."  
We walked into a large store room, with many desks and a few other doors off
of it. Jack showed me the armory and the recovery room.  
  
My first mission after training was not difficult, we busted the gang and I
was promoted to a first class "rush mate". After that were the ranks, the
commanders and sergeants. Many of my "co-workers" were still third or second
class rush mates. I dated Mark and we were now more serious. One day after
walking into work, I put on my vest and gear to train. I walked to the
training room, where simulated fights took place, but the red sirens started
flashing/howling. When that occurred we were ordered to stand in position. As
usual, one of our commanders (this time it was Jack) explained the situation.  
"We have a problem." He reported. "An underground group known as the Kixes are
at work building nuclear weapons, so they can threaten the white house for
power. Not a big group...only about thirty. Not the first time, a typical
bust. Okay, let's get 'em. In and out...got it? In and out. Let's go!"  
All went as planned until the bust came to a screeching halt. I felt a gun at
my back. My breath stopped. We were taught what to do in these types of
situations, but my mind went blank. I saw people stop and stare. I saw Jack,
he turned around and looked at me, and a horrified look came over his face. My
insides turned to ice, my blood running cold. I saw someone aim a gun at Jack.
I swallowed and opened my mouth to scream, but it was too late. A member of
the clan saw his opportunity and shot Jack. I threw myself on the ground as my
own gunman fired. Only nicked. I felt blood trickle down my face where the
bullet nicked the side of my cheek. They shot our leader. I thought. We're
done for. Everyone else seemed to think that way also, I saw by the looks on
their faces. At that moment, something came over me. Something I didn't know I
possessed. I went into fighting mode. They thought they had won. They were
wrong. Seizing the opportunity, I spun around kicking my gunman in the head.
He went down, and didn't get back up. I went after the next guy I saw; nothing
hurt, nothing else mattered, and nothing could stop me. I don't know how long
I was fighting, but I stopped when I came to the weapon control box.  
"If you don't surrender!" I cried. "I'll set it off...we have nothing to
lose!" I screamed. To my amazement, the remaining members dropped their
weapons and got down on their knees. I don't know when the battle turned, but
my fellow men must've started fighting again when I did, their numbers were
very thin. I noticed tears were pouring down my face.  
"Jack!" I cried. I ran over to where a few people were assisting him. The
others were holding the cult until back-up came. He was conscious, gritting
his teeth in pain as the others pulled him to a standing position. He looked
at me and smiled a little as they carried him away.  
"Ms. Grant?" I turned and saw a younger boy addressing me.  
"Yes?"  
"Back-up is here."  
"Thank you, John" I said, recognizing him after a little while. "How many
others are injured?"  
"About fifteen."  
"Fifteen out of forty. That's nearly half." I gasped.  
"I was counting you." I frowned slightly, and looked down; I was bleeding in
at least five places.  
"Hey," I gasped, "you're right...I-" Everything went dark.  
  
I woke up, gasping for air. The room was cool and dark; there were a couple of
windows letting light in. I was laying on a soft bed...The recovery room! I
ached in a couple places, but not bad. I looked to my right and recognized my
friend, Jackie on the bed, unaware of my gaze. I slowly got out of bed, a
walked down a couple of beds. Jack! I found him.  
"Jack, Jack." I said, shaking him a little. He made some small noises, grunts
mostly but I could barely hear when he spoke.  
"That's me." His lips barely moved.  
"Thank goodness you're all right. Where'd you get shot?" I whispered.  
"My leg...the stupid oaf shot me in the leg." He opened his eyes a little, and
he smiled, just a little. I moved away from his bed and suddenly the world
started spinning.  
"Holly?" Jack's voice was louder then it was a minute before, more alarmed. I
tried to respond, but only succeeded in turning around and looking at him. The
last thing I saw was the ground rushing up to meet me.  
"You can't go running around on low blood," the nurse said as she put me back
in bed.  
  
"He's staying with, who?" I asked. My father was standing in front of me; my
mother at his side.  
"You, Holly, please. Jack can't do normal things easily anymore and he is on
medical leave."  
"But-"  
"Holly..." My dad warned "his brother is bringing down some clothes from his
apartment."  
"Can't he stay here?"  
"The recovery room is too crowded."  
"Can't he stay with his brother?"  
"His brother is going away for his work."  
"Can't he stay with Patty?"  
"She'll have too many questions...plus he knows you better than Patty." I
decided not to argue.  
"Okay, let's go." I turned to Jack, sitting in his wheelchair, a big cast over
his right leg.  
  
"Home sweet home." I said, pushing him to the elevator, and punching in my
floor number.  
"My brother should be by any minute." Jack was kind of subdued by his medicine
and looked like he was about to pass out.  
"Jack...you okay?"  
"Yeah, yeah...no, not really." He mumbled. I pushed him into my apartment, and
over to the couch. I helped him on.  
"Jack..." I whispered. He was out. The doorbell rang, it was J.R.  
"Hi," I said, taking Jack's suitcase. "Thanks."  
"Have fun going to..."  
"Africa, I'm a reporter."  
"Well, I guess, good luck."  
"Thanks for looking after my brother."  
"No problem."  
"Bye."  
"Bye." I shut the door. The next few days Jack would only wake up occasionally
and I would either be out running errands or meeting some friends. One day, I
came home to find Jack awake, watching T.V.  
"Charming." I said, walking through the door.  
"Hello to you too." I walked over to the couch and sat next to him.  
"How are you?" I asked.  
"Pretty good...considering."  
"Good, are you hungry?"  
"Kind of."  
"Alright...I'm going to make spaghetti."  
"Sounds excellent."  
"Good." I had a very small wooden table near my kitchen. We sat there and ate,
conversing. He looked at me seriously.  
"You fight well."  
"Jack...listen, I'm sorry about not remembering what to do and getting you
shot."  
"It's okay. I forget too, we're all just human."  
"Jack," I whispered. "I'm sorry, I'm really sorry."  
"Stop...look at me." I turned my eyes off the floor. "I'm proud you led the
troops after I was shot. Don't apologize anymore." Our eyes were locked. I
leaned over the table, Oh my gosh...I want to kiss Jack! I thought. The
doorbell rang. I jumped a little, than excused myself from the table. Mark was
in the hallway.  
"Hi!" I said, kissing him on the cheek. "Can I talk to you in the hall?" I
asked, stepping out.  
"Sure."  
"Sorry, tonight isn't a good night for me; you know...I told you about Jack."  
"Yeah...he okay?"  
"Yeah, he's fine, but he just woke up and-"  
"I understand. Listen I'll call you tomorrow. We'll get together later this
week, okay?"  
"That sounds great. Thanks for being so understanding."  
"Sure, anything for you." He smiled.  
"Bye." We kissed. I walked back in my apartment; Jack was sitting in the same
spot at the table. When I walked in, he just looked at me.  
"What?"  
"You didn't beak up with him...did you?"  
"No, why?"  
"After what just happened?"  
"Jack...I'm sorry. I just got carried away. You like my sister...and I like
Mark. End of story." I started clearing and washing the dishes.  
"No!" He cried. "Not end of story...end of nothing, nothing ended.
You...we...just began something."  
"Jack, Patty likes you. Please don't break her heart."  
"Oh, okay...so I'll pretend like I don't love you and keep seeing her."  
"Jack!"  
"What?" He almost yelled.  
"You love me?" He didn't answer. "No...you..." He looked away. "We can't."  
"Why not?"  
"We work together. It would be weird."  
"No...it wouldn't."  
"Jack...please don't do this." I begged.  
"Do what? I can't do anything...you wont let me."  
"I knew it...I just knew if you came here..." I looked over at him. We just
looked at each other for a minute or two. I felt tears start to form.  
"Please Holly..." Jack pleaded, "Please don't cry." I tried to push them back.  
I went to my room, and closed the door. I buried my face in my pillow. Oh my
gosh...I think I do too. I think I...I think I love Jack. I don't know how
long I stayed in my room, but it was ten fifteen when I came back out. Jack
was sitting in his wheelchair, staring at the floor. He looked up at me as I
walked out.  
"Jack...I think..." I stopped. "I love you too." He smiled at me. "But what do
you know about me?" I asked,  
"You tell me things, while we're training or working. You obviously don't know
how much." He sighed. "You love dark chocolate, you love to hike, your sister
Patty is the perfectionist and your sister Bess is the "pretty one." You love
when it rains because it's different. You love to ski, you like mint chocolate
chip ice cream. You stay home sometimes...sometimes just to feel safe in
everything you know, but other times, you venture into the unknown and take
risks. Sometimes you feel like...you feel like you are the only person who can
understand the way you are, or what you feel. Your eyes embarrass you, but you
should take pride in them." My breath had stopped. Nothing else existed, I
didn't care either. Just me and him. "I love it." he said. "I love it all."  
"Jack." I whispered. "I can't breathe." My legs gave out and I opened my eyes
while I was on the floor.  
"I must've put on quite a performance." He said, smiling over me. I sat up,
hitting him on the arm.  
"Shut up." I grunted. "Yes, you did... You like kickboxing and granny smith
apples. Your favorite color is green and your brother is charming." I said
with a smile.  
"Shut up." He kicked me playfully with his good leg.  
"You don't care what stands in your way but when you want something, you have
to have it. You sing along to music in your car to make people laugh. That's
what you always do, Jack. If you're not making people faint," I chuckled
again, "You're making some snide remark that has people dying to strangle
you...or kiss you...but usually they can't make up their mind. You have a way
of getting everybody to think you're in control...when sometimes, you're not."
His eyes were locked on mine. "You make everyone think you're invincible...and
I...I love it." I smiled. "I love all of it." While I was making my speech, I
was slowly getting to my knees. We were eye level.  
"Tell me again why I'm not kissing you."  
"You're too dumbstruck."  
"Got that right."  
  
I threw myself on the cement. I thought back to my apartment, Jack was in
there making calls, watching T.V. We had stayed up all night talking, until I
fell asleep. Gunshots filled the air. Concentrate. I closed my eyes, exhaling
slowly. Jumping up, I aimed at my target, a guy in a black suit... a mafia
member. The warehouse was dark, filled with the smell of fish and old cigar
smoke. A sharp pain hit just below my ribs. The lights came up and the damp,
dark warehouse faded out. I was standing in a white room, the training room.  
"Who shot me?" I yelled.  
"The guy on the right...you didn't see him? He was two feet away!" My trainer,
Drake, yelled at me. Drake was a robust, veteran rush commander. "What's wrong
with you today, where is your mind?" he asked. I started to make an excuse.
"WHERE is your mind?? Really, I want to know."  
"Captain...I...back home. My boyfriend..."  
"Well get your head out of the clouds or you'll be shot!" He spat.  
"Right. sorry...I'm SORRY!" I yelled.  
"Go home Holly, get some sleep. Because if you come back tomorrow like this,
I'm going to report you to the Chief Commander."  
"Thank you...bye sir." I walked to the changing room, slamming the door open.  
"What's wrong?" Jackie asked.  
"He's sending me home." I murmured. I ripped off my gear and shoved it in my
locker. "Bye, Jackie."  
  
I stormed in the apartment, slamming the door. Throwing my keys on the counter
I looked around for Jack.  
"Jack?" I yelled. There was no answer. I saw a note on the counter. All it
said was; 151, White dock rd. (on the harbor)  
-your friend, Ricky.   
Ricky. I hate Ricky. Ricky is the leader of the Italian Mafia, and now...Ricky
has my love interest. I picked up the phone.  
"Hi, Karin. Yeah...I'm going to need some backup." I told her the address and
hung up.  
I kicked open the door to the warehouse. Jack was in the middle of the room
with his mouth taped. Ricky stepped in front of him.  
"Listen girlie...I need infor-" I shut him up with a punch and spinning high
kick.  
"Quite frankly...I don't care. I'm having a bad day...stay out of my way."
Other members jumped down to protect their boss. I laughed a little. "You know
guys...I'm glad you want to fight. I need to take out some frustration. Hold
on one second." I picked up my cell phone.  
"Hey Mark, I'm sorry we have to break up. No, no sure we can still go to
dinner Saturday night. What? What did you just call me? Oh, sorry. I heard
something else. No, it's okay. What? You were doing what with who, while we
were dating?" I hung up. I screamed. Some of the guys backed up. I went after
them.  
  
"I've never seen you fight like that."  
"I know...I was actually enjoying it." I had to send backup away after I
knocked them all out.  
"I haven't broken up with your sister yet." Jack spit out. We were sitting in
my apartment, eating dinner. Jack was in his wheelchair. I looked at him. YOU
HAVEN'T WHAT? I kept my outside under control even though my insides were
screaming. I closed my eyes to control myself. I got up and walked into my
bedroom, slamming the door, a perfect end to an absolutely perfect day. I
walked back out.  
"Jack... I thought...I thought you loved me."  
"I do."  
"Then WHY haven't you broken up with her?" I yelled the word why, but tried to
keep my voice down a little for the rest of the sentence.  
"I didn't want to hurt her." I started chuckling, I started scaring myself. I
broke into a cynical laugh.  
"I just got sent home early from work, yelled at, I broke up with my boyfriend
to be with you...who I was saving from the Italian Mafia...and I find out he's
been dating my best friend...and you haven't broken up with my sister because
you were scared to hurt her feelings. Do I have that right? Did I leave
anything OUT? Because I certainly wouldn't want to, now would I?" Jack looked
at me like I was the boogeyman who had just stepped out of the closet.  
"Yes, that would be correct."  
"Get out of my house."  
"Please Holly, baby..."  
"Jack...go live with my sister, after all she's the one you love."  
"Holly..."  
"Yes, Jack?"  
"Please calm down."  
"Calm? You want calm? Hahahaha! He wants calm! This is calm, baby!" Jack bent
over and put his head in his hands. His voice sound muffled.  
"Holly, I love you." When he looked back up at me, he looked so tired, and
spent. My heart sank. I sat down in a chair across from him. I put my head
down on the table; I imagined I was somewhere else...at the beach. I was far
away, just the sound of the water, the seagulls and the sand under my feet.  
"Holly?" Jack asked. "You okay?"  
"Yes Jack." I said lifting my head and looking at him. "I'm sorry..."  
"We all have our bad days, babe. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for not breaking up with
your sister. I will tomorrow. You're the only one I want to be with."  
  
I walked in headquarters the next morning. My co worker Hal came in my
station. "Commander Darhl wants to see you in her office." Commander Darhl was
Jack's rank commander.  
"Hello?" I asked, seeing her door was open.  
"Hello, hello Ms. Grant. I've been hearing a lot about you this week, about
how you saved your troops from failure...your mafia run-in. We would like to
promote you."  
"We?"  
"CFA...The council force advisers."  
"Right."  
"You are now promoted to be IF."  
"IF?"  
"Independent fighter."  
"An IF...like Major Harry?"  
"Yes, but you will have a rush force of your own." I learned the system over
time.  
The different fields:  
Rush force, IF, Detective, SA, SFs, Hacker, Control (station), and last...ACD.  
I basically understand that the lowest going up as follows;  
Rush forces:  
Third class rush  
Second class rush  
First class rush  
Ranks (apply for all)  
Head  
Commander  
Chief  
  
The IF's are an entirely different category: The IF's can work independently
(hence the name) or with the rush forces on assignments. The IF's are higher
in ranking than the Commander, but lower then the Chief. If a Chief takes
control, he does. The commanders must answer to the IF commands. In the ranks;
the number one is the highest, like  
First Commander; First Head, or Second Chief...etc  
The lowest is usually three, sometimes four. The highest person in all the
system is the Chief Commander, who oversees all and has power over all. I am
now an IF.  
"Thank you so much ma'am... I won't let you down."  
"I'm sure you will not. Now, your first assignment deals with a man named Mr.
Ridley. He is super rich, super arrogant and super old. He thought if he got
into the underground stuff he'd be swimming in his every desire. Now, he's
caught up with Fox."  
Fox is the most notorious underground villain who ever has walked the earth.
He robs banks without anyone noticing, he steals without any footage of him
doing it, he uses the cops like puppets making them do exactly what he wants
them to do. He thinks of himself as good as the night fox in Ocean's Twelve
(hence his name...fox.) He nearly is. Fox and Ridley are meeting tonight at
eight o'clock by the docks. There is going to be some type of exchange. We
don't know what...but it's your job to gather info. That's all, just
information."  
"Thank you...it will be done." I nodded my respects to her and left her
office.  
  
Fox turned out to be an attractive man, dark haired, medium height, and dark
eyes. I was surprised I could see him that well; it was dark at night in the
harbor. Ridley, however; was not. Ridley was tall and lanky, with light
brown/graying hair and a brown mustache. I was on top of a warehouse in the
harbor and the cold tiles underneath my stomach were threatening to cave. I
was looking out, towards the ocean with Ridley and Fox fifty feet below. I had
an earpiece in, talking to Boone Sroth, my fellow IF partner on this mission.
I was looking through binoculars, dressed in my all black gear. The night air
seemed cold from the draft of the ocean...even though it was summer. I let my
binoculars wonder, there were at least five men on each side...and a
woman...the blond haired woman who came out of my closet was standing on Fox's
side! I had been trained to read lips, but no one spoke yet. Fox and Ridley
shook hands.  
"Do you have the bracelet yet?" Ridley asked Fox.  
"No, Marsha wasn't expecting the girl." Fox said, looking around to check the
harbor was clear.  
"It is yours isn't it?"  
"Yes." Fox replied. He looked confident. No, it couldn't be his...my
grandmother gave that to me...  
"What's happening?" I jumped at the voice hissing in my ear.  
"Fox is trying to pawn a bracelet to Ridley...my bracelet." I whispered.  
"What bracelet?"  
"Some valuable old bracelet..."I trailed off, trying to read what they were
saying.  
"Marsha didn't tell the girl what it was actually for." Fox resembled someone
I knew...I just couldn't put my finger on it.  
"Good. You will get it?"  
"Give me a week, should be sooner than you expect."  
"Fine." They finished their business with a handshake. Each walked their
separate ways.  
Unexpectedly, the roof gave in; I was too distracted thinking of the case, to
concentrate on where I had put my weight. I had accidentally put my hand where
there was a hole in the roof. I had no time to scream, I just went through the
roof. I looked up to grab something while falling through the air; my hand
struck a beam and I clung to it forgetting the underground criminals near-by.  
"You okay?" I heard Boone in my ear.  
"Fell through the roof." I managed to say. Footsteps echoed through the alley,
heading towards the door to the old, abandon warehouse I was dangling in. I
can't let them see me! Summoning every last bit of strength, I put my other
hand on the beam and pulled myself up, yelling in exasperation. The door
opened as I scrambled onto the beam.  
"Fan out...someone was spying." I heard Fox's voice echo around the room. "It
was her..." He mumbled. "Go up." I stood on the beam, knowing if they got to
the roof before I did, I was dead meat. I looked at my bloodied hands and
jumped to grab the next highest beam, from there I went hand over hand
horizontally towards a window, swinging like a monkey.  
"Up there!" I heard Fox scream. Gunfire surrounded me, I was found but I just
kept going...I had to. I kicked through the window and went crashing onto the
roof of a building close by. My limbs were aching and sore.  
"Holly?" I heard a frantic Boone in my ear.  
"I'm okay...for now." I turned and looked around; the roof was about two
stories shorter that the warehouse I was just on, but the roof was flat with a
door leading to its many levels.  
"Stop!" I heard a male voice boom behind me, one of Fox's men. I didn't stop,
I ran to the door, and flew down the staircase, ignoring the gunfire left in
my wake. I ran through another door on the staircase three levels down. I
heard the door above me from the roof slam and others chasing me. I came into
a white, darkly lit, narrow hallway and had half a mind to turn around and
choose a different door, but the others were catching up quickly. There were
about five doors in the hallway; I looked in the first, a cleaning closet. I
ran to the second, finding a room with someone in it on a bed. They sat up,
and screamed, a woman's scream. What is this place? I wondered. If she didn't
stop, I would be discovered. I knew coaxing wouldn't help, so I ran over and
knocked her out. I heard the others in the hallway. My mind was racing. I
turned this way and that, trying to find an escape. I finally caught sight of
a window; I ran to look out, no good, only concrete below. At the last minute,
I saw it, the laundry shoot. I dove down and heard someone burst into the
room. I was traveling down a narrow, metal shoot and went flying out onto
cold, hard concrete. A laundry room! It must be in the basement, there were no
windows. The door to the basement opened, an idea quickly formulated in my
head. I took off my black gear, showing my brightly colored street clothes
underneath. Grabbing a pile of laundry, I started putting it in the washer,
when a man came down. I turned and screamed.  
"Shut up!" he yelled. I closed my mouth. "You see someone come through here?"  
"Oh, you mean the wretched girl who is dressed in all black?"  
"Yeah! That's the one."  
"She came down here a second ago and told me to be quiet...while she slipped
upstairs."  
He seemed to buy it, turning around he called up to his men, telling them to
search the streets. I smiled to myself and calmly walked upstairs, a laundry
basket in my hands.  
  
Feeling drained, I walked into head quarters. I went to the door second to the
right and punched in the code.  
"Holly! You're okay!" My friend Karin ran up to me. "Boone is in your office,
telling IF first commander Hughes what happened. He said all he could do was
listen to what happened in horror." I walked down the hallway, thanking Karin
and turned into the office Boone and I shared. I saw Boone's puppy-dog-like
features relax. He has brown curly hair and big brown eyes.  
"Holly!" He ran over to me, hugging me. "You're okay."  
"Yeah, thanks for your concern but, Commander, if it's okay with you, can I go
home?"  
"Yes, Holly, Boone's the last one here anyway. You can tell me everything
tomorrow."  
"Thank you." We left.  
  
Walking in my apartment, I saw Jack asleep on the couch. I smiled to myself,
being very quiet not to wake him. It was midnight. I took off my shoes and saw
Jack's note.  
Made you some dinner, I'm going back to work in six days!  
Love,  
Who else?  
I smiled, looking at the cold, hard Easy Mac he had made. I put in the
microwave and ate a few bites.  
"I broke up with your sister." Jack's voice startled me; I looked over at him
as he lowered himself into his wheelchair.  
"I'm sorry I woke you."  
"I'm not tired anyway, but you look drained." I told him about what happened.
He looked at me for a moment.  
"Holly, what if you shouldn't do this job after all-"  
"Jack, despite how much my life is in danger...ironically, it's the first time
I've ever felt alive." I silently thanked God for helping me tonight. He
looked at me through concerned eyes, but smiled after a minute.  
"I think I know just how you feel."  
  
"Fox...he, he knows me." I turned to Boone the next morning.  
"Yeah...he used to work here."  
"How old is he?"  
"About ten years older than you."  
"I want forces in my place...the bracelet to be guarded; we can set up a
trap."  
"Holly...he knows you know he's coming, he won't do it this week."  
"And what if he does..." I trailed off, reading an e-mail open on Boone's
computer.  
"Boone?"  
"Yeah?"  
"Have you read that?" He turned to look at his computer,  
"No, I just pulled it up."  
  
Boone, I went out with the special forces to infiltrate Fox's warehouse, we
got a threat late last night from him and are going to investigate. Tell Holly
not to worry.  
Commander Hughes.  
"Oh my gosh." I said, realization hitting me like a train.  
"What?" Boone inquired. "You have a very odd look on your face, like you are
going to puke or something."  
"Boone," I thought back to last night. "It's sooner than I expected."  
"What?"  
"Fox knew, he knew..."  
"Knew what Holly?"  
"He knew I would come in today, looking for back up. He sent the letter to
clear the other forces...giving some indication of where he was so they'd all
go. He's getting that bracelet today...right now." I looked at Boone, he stood
up. We both started running at the same time. I ran out of the office, down
the hallway and out into the front room, without stopping I ran out the front
doors.  
"My car!" I gasped, pointing to the VW bug. We ran into the car and I sped
down the street.  
  
Bursting into the apartment, I found Jack in his chair, facing the door.  
"Jack! Are you okay?"  
"Yeah," he said. He flashed his eyes, only for a second, but I saw it, and I
knew they were in the apartment. I could see it in his eyes anyway.  
"Good. I thought...oh never mind. I have backup coming..." I bluffed.  
"You're bluffing." Fox stepped out of my room.  
"Hello, Fox."  
"You know who I am." He had a deep, cold voice. "Last night was fun, wasn't
it? I thought you'd figure out I was here, wasn't expecting him though." He
pointed to Boone.  
"Happy to surprise you." I spat. Fox nodded his head a little and a shot rang
out. I had no idea where it came from, but it hit Boone. "Boone!" I screamed
as he fell back against the wall, grabbing his arm where the bullet entered.  
"Good, now it's just you and me." Fox said as he kicked Jack wheelchair so it
went flying into the other room. "Close the door," he ordered his men.  
"And your back up, you sissy." I snarled.  
"Come on sis...it's all fair."  
"What did you just call me?"  
"Sis, oh, come on...don't you remember? Your old brother...Mick?"  
"But Mom said Dad only had girls..."  
"He does. I'm not your father's." my breathing increased.  
"And that's my bracelet...my grandmother gave it to me...you know, my mom's
mom...until they cast me out of the family, and my mom left my dad for your
dad."  
"Now, I wonder why she'd do that." He bit his bottom lip as he walked five
feet away from me.  
"Come on sis, it's all fun and games," he mocked.  
"No," I growled, "it's not." I jumped back and kicked him in the chest.
Another man jumped out of the curtains, leveling his gun.  
"No!" he yelled, "she's all mine." He came towards me, "Now you can see what
my father taught me." We went into combat, sister against brother. He punched,
I blocked. His first punch hit me in the jaw so hard, I saw brightly swirling
colors for a second or two. He kept on trying to punch my face, so at the last
minute I ducked, kneed him in the stomach and flicked my head up so it hit his
jaw, sending him backwards.  
"And that's what my father taught me." I rasped, gasping for air. He looked
wildly at me...a light burning in his eyes.  
"You will die for this."  
"I doubt it." He lunged at me; I sidestepped and brought my knee up again,
knocking the wind out of him. The angrier he got, the more determined to hurt
me he became; therefore, he made stupid mistakes and turned more like a wild
animal than a fighter.  
"Your mom will pay."  
"Let's cut the soap opera drama." I squinted at him.  
"Get her." He suddenly composed himself whilst his men grabbed me. I fought
their grip, but they were pulling me in every direction.  
"Stop, let go of me!" I screamed at them. I looked directly at Fox. "You
coward." I yelled. His face became distorted with anger, he briskly walked up
to me and punched me in the face, my head whipped around and snapped back.
Blood started trickling down my face. He punched me some more and kicked me in
the stomach. I saw my world start to turn and I suddenly became nauseous.  
"DO NOT CALL ME A COWARD!!" He screamed in my face. I spat on him.  
"Like father, like son." I managed to gasp. He bit his lip, his face turning
red.  
"Now, I'm going to kill you slowly."  
"Don't touch her." Jack was standing behind Fox, who spun around to face Jack.
Jack was holding a gun level to Fox's leg. "See how you like it." He cocked
the gun, started to pull the trigger, but Fox was fast, he dove behind me.  
"Shoot through your girl." Fox sneered.  
"Do it." I pleaded. I really wanted to pull the gun for Jack, so it would end
the existence of my evil half-brother. Someone started knocking at my front
door.  
"Special forces, open up."  
"Fire escape!" Fox yelled as his men darted. They dropped me on the floor in
their panic. Jack collapsed on the floor. I stood up on shaking legs. The door
burst open, the forces pouring in.  
"Fire escape." I said, indicating the open door. I saw Boone outside with the
paramedics. Commander Hughes strolled in.  
"Commander." I said, nodding my head to him.  
"Ms. Grant, I'm sorry, we should have known the letter was a trap. Then all
this could be avoided. We're taking you off the case." He turned to walk away.  
"No! Please sir. I would like to finish this case. I need to." He looked me up
and down like I was crazy. He shrugged.  
"If you please." He walked out. I spun around.  
"Jack! How did you get out?" People were helping him back into his chair.  
"Through the window."  
"Jack!" I whispered, kneeling in front of him.  
"Man, that hurt." He said, looking a little pale. "You okay?" He asked.  
"Yeah, I think so." I stood up, looking into the mirror. Parts of my face were
swollen and black and blue. There was blood trickling from a corner of my
mouth. I looked down at him. "I look like death." I said, appalled at my
appearance. Jack laughed.  
"You look beautiful to me." I rolled my eyes at him. "Okay, maybe a little
like death." He admitted.  
  
I visited Boone in the hospital the next day. He was sitting up in bed, as I
came in wheeling Jack. He looked over weakly.  
"Boone! Oh Gosh...Boone." I moaned sympathetically. "I brought you some
chocolate." I held up the box I was carrying. He smiled.  
"Hi to you too." He said weakly. "I called the forces...I was afraid he would
kill you."  
"He said he was going to. Thanks for saving my life." I smiled.  
"Anytime. Oh...this hurts."  
"I know...I was shot...twice." Jack said. I turned to him.  
"Jack...can we have a minute?" he stared dumbly at me. "Alone?" I asked. He
wheeled himself out muttering under his breath.  
"Boone, Fox is my-"  
"Half-brother...I know. I only lost consciousness on my way here."  
"I have to finish it. I have to finish him." I said, my thoughts wandering.  
"I was worried about you." He said. I felt a pang of emotion for him. Not
Boone, too.  
"I was scared Fox had killed you."  
"He nearly did." Boone joked.  
"Boone..." The nurse walked in, telling me it was time to go.  
"I'll visit you tomorrow."  
"Okay."  
"Bye."  
"Bye."  
I walked out of his room, thinking of how much I was going to hurt Fox the
next time I got my hands on him. I noticed Jack staring at me.  
"Yes? Hello?" I said.  
"You like him."  
"Yeah...he's my partner."  
"No...you really like him. If he wasn't shot...I'd punch him."  
"Jack!" I squeaked. "You wouldn't."  
"Oh...I would."  
"Jack...I love you."  
"Convince me." I leaned down and kissed him, light at first, but then a little
more passionate, hanging for a moment or two. People were staring.  
"Convinced?" I hissed.  
"Not really, show me one more time..." I hit Jack on the arm.  
"No. We're leaving."  
"Okay, okay...pushy, pushy."  
  
"You didn't tell me I had a psycho half-brother!" I yelled at my mom while
walking into the kitchen.  
"What did you just say?" She frowned at me, as if I told her there was a giant
slug in my ear.  
"You heard me!" I yelled, angrily knocking off the pots and pans off that were
drying from the sink. They clanged onto the floor.  
"Holly!" My mom sounded appalled.  
"Mick?"  
"How do you...who told you...?"  
"He tried to kill me, mother!"  
"What Mick? He tried to what?"  
"Kill me...you walked out on him." My mom turned away and started washing more
dishes.  
"That was a long time ago." She said quickly. "Do you want some eggs?" She
asked, turning around.  
"No, thanks. I've already eaten." I said. "How could you walk out on him?" I
saw my mom slowly turn around, tears in her eyes.  
"I have regretted that decision all my life, Holly...all my life. I knew it
would catch up to me sometime... but it was sooner then I expected."  
"What?" I asked, almost not believing my ears. "The last sentence...what did
you just say?"  
"It was sooner then I expected...why?" She looked quizzically at me.  
"Mother...what have you done?" I yelled. She just looked at me.  
"Holly? What do you mean?" A slow smile spread across her face.  
"He wants to hurt you too, Mom."  
"Mick would never hurt me." Her eyes narrowed.  
"Mom..."  
"He came in last night, paid me a visit."  
"Mom..." My voice kept on rising.  
"He promised me that I could keep my life now..."  
"Mom...what have you done?" I screeched.  
"If only I helped him." She finished. I turned out of the kitchen, running
down the hall. "all my riches...all my things...your father...I could keep
them all...if only I helped him..." She called after me. Fox stepped into my
path, knocking me down.  
"No one's going to save you now." He smiled wickedly. He walked towards me as
I scrambled to my feet. "Not even...Mark." Mark stepped out of the shadows,
smiling.  
"Hey doll. I never cheated." He said.  
"Mark? You were a spy? To spy on me?"  
"Sorry," he smiled guiltily.  
"This is the end, Holly. Goodbye." He pulled out a gun, and shot me in the
chest. Searing, blinding pain hit me, I screamed, collapsing on the ground.  
"You...coward." I managed to gasp, he kicked me...the world went black.  
  
I opened my eyes. Light was shining in them. I blocked out the light with my
hand. Something on my wrist caught my eye, a hospital band! My eyes slowly
adjusted to the light, Jack's voice came rushing back to me.  
"Holly, please...please wake up." it sounded like he was crying. "Holly, I
love you and you are the only one I will ever love. I'm sorry I couldn't save
you...I'm sorry." I remember wanting to answer him, fighting to answer, but my
mouth wouldn't move. I saw a nurse come walking cautiously over.  
"Holly?" She asked.  
"Where am I?" I groaned.  
"The memorial hospital in Buffalo."  
"What...what happened?"  
"You've been in a coma for fifteen months...a year and three months."
