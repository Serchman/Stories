**** Intro:** John had a planned need for that particular taxi............ 

* * *

John Pickford walked out of the railway station carrying a small but expensive
briefcase.  
He surveyed the rank of taxi's waiting to pick up passengers from the express
that had just left the platform on its way to York.  
He saw the taxi that he wanted in the waiting line, and smoked a cigarette as
the taxis slowly moved forward picking up fares.  
Eventually the taxi he wanted crept slowly forward to second position in the
queue and watching a young couple approaching the first taxi John walked
briskly forward.  
He opened the back door of the taxi and took his seat.  
The driver looked enquiringly into the mirror.  
"Where to boss?", he smiled.  
"Ripon please", replied John.  
"I'm sorry mate but that's too far for me at the moment, but I can get you
another cab immediately", said the driver.  
"Look", said John." I have to be in Ripon in an hour. There's two hundred quid
in it for you if you get me there in time".  
The driver looked at his watch. Hmm. that's a two-hour round trip, but he felt
he could make it in time.  
"OK, he replied, but I have to let the Controller know where I'm going. Won't
take a moment".  
He called the office and told them that he had a fare to Ripon, but that he
would be back in plenty of time to pick up his usual 5.30 p.m. passenger.  
He stepped on the accelerator and off they sped.  
It was 4.00 p.m. and it was becoming quite dark when the passenger asked him
to stop in a lay-by so that he could relieve himself.  
The driver did as asked and as John opened the door to get out he clubbed the
driver behind the ear with a felt-covered cosh.  
The driver slumped low in his seat.  
Casually John walked around and removed the keys from the ignition.  
With them he opened the boot of the car and he hefted the driver into it.  
He opened the briefcase and removed a roll of duct-tape which he used to
fasten the driver's arms and legs together.  
He used the remainder of the tape to gag the driver's mouth.  
Having ensured that the driver could breath easily, he closed the boot lid and
went and sat in the driving seat of the taxi.  
He lit a cigarette as he calmly went through part two of his plan.

From his briefcase he took a false moustache and affixed it to his upper lip
with a smear of adhesive, and they he added long sideburns by using the same
adhesive.  
Heavy rimmed spectacles completed the disguise.  
Looking in the mirror he was more than satisfied with the transformation.  
He took the briefcase and removed the remaining article from it.  
He sat smoking in the lay-by until 5 p.m.then re-started the engine and slowly
drove back into town.  
At 5.30 p.m. he coasted to a stop outside of McDonalds restaurant.  
The manager was just walking through the doors and he gave a cheery wave to
the taxi-driver.  
He had climbed into the back seat before he actually saw that this was not his
regular driver.  
"Where's Arthur tonight then?", he asked.  
"Oh, Arthur had a fare to Ripon and he thought he would be back in time, but
he's running late. I was in the rank at the station when they radioed me to
pick you up. Arthur's on his way back now, but he'll be another half hour at
least".  
"Ah, I see", replied the manager.  
John drove up the main street and slowed to a stop in a darkened private
driveway.  
He turned to his passenger and said,  
"Well what happens now is that you get out of this taxi, not forgetting to
leave that fat money bag on the seat as you leave, and by the way, please tell
the police when they arrive that Arthur is in the boot".  
As he spoke he levelled the gun that he had taken from the brief-case at the
manager.  
"OK, I'm leaving", stuttered the manager and he leapt out of the taxi leaving
the money bag on the back seat.  
John gunned the motor and roared off into the night.  
He drove to within two hundred yards of the railway station, and alighting
from the taxi, he walked briskly into the station and boarded the 5.50 p.m.
train for London.  
He went immediately into the toilet and opened the money bag. He counted the
contents slowly.  
Two thousand three hundred quid. Not bad for four hours work!  
He peeled off the moustache and sideburns and washed his face with the luke-
warm water from the tap.

He took a seat and opened a newspaper that some friendly traveller had left
behind. He sighed contentedly. All in a day's work!
