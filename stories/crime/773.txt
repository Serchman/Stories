**** Intro:** A Bangkok private detective does a favour 

* * *

No matter how hard I tried I just couldn't prevent my eyelids parting in
response to the phone. After several rings I languidly reached out from my bed
to a half empty bottle of lukewarm water. I took a swig, and then swiping at
the receiver I tentatively pressed it against my ear. It could be a job. In
better times I would have ignored it.  
'Yo,' I crooked recognising the voice immediately. I tried to concentrate on
what was being said but she spoke too quickly. I took a second swig of
hangover balm and 'Esk!' I cursed noticing the water was full of dead ants.  
'Sorry sis, not you. Look, give me 30 minutes. No make it an hour,' I said
clearing my throat. 'Yeh, sure, no worries.' I assured her on the subject of
being late.  
Within an hour and with my shirt beginning to stick to my back I reached Sue
Young's foreign visa processing offices opposite the British embassy. Not that
they were allowed to process any visas but for a fee they could arrange for
you and your partner to get married in a day and for a bit more they would
also check all the visa documentation you needed to take her home.  
As I walked in Sue looked up from her key broad. The screen flickered light
blue in the reflection of her glasses.  
'Hiya' she smiled. Good she was in a good mood. A good time to tell her I
didn't have the rent.  
'Hi' I smiled back. 'Could I have a word, I've got a problem with...' but the
phone interrupted me. She picked it up while looking at me quizzically and
then frowned. She had known me too long not to know what the problem was.  
'I'll talk to you later,' I mouthed silently. Small black but not too
unattractive eyes stared back. I harried passed her to a door at the back of
the shop and to my office. I closed the frosted glass door behind me. Even
during the day the small office was dark. Switching on a fluorescent tube I
took a bottle of cold water from a rented fridge. Before sitting down at a
small but clean desk I switched on the ceiling fan. I sat in silence drying
under a vortex of stale air.  
A figure appeared outside my door. It was too obvious to be anything other
than a woman. After a few moments of muffled voices my door handle twisted and
after a few more the door opened and Lydia stepped in. She wore a white sequin
tunic tucked into a pair of soft grey joggers. With an easy smile she sat down
opposite me. With a perfectly symmetrical face she inherited from our mother's
side she wasn't short of suitors. Her blond hair was cut short and fastened
back with a large crystal butterfly clip.  
'You should marry her,' she said as you might ask for the salt or pepper.  
I smiled at the thought. 'You think so?'  
'Free rent.'  
'I get that anyway.'  
'Not for ever.'  
'Is this a social visit?' I asked not wanting to be drawn on the subject.  
'I want your help. No, my friend wants your help,' she corrected herself.  
'I can't afford to do freebies.' I interjected a little too quickly.  
'What, no money again,' she smirked in a way that she knew would rattle me. I
didn't want to tell her I had lost in a game of poker and instead, shrugged my
shoulders. The last time we argued we didn't make up for six months.  
'What's your day rate then?' She asked sensibly leading the subject back onto
safe ground.  
'Bhat 2000 per day plus expenses.'  
'Any student discount?'  
'Is she a student?'  
'She knows you from DPU.'  
'What's her nickname?'  
'Nok,' she answered, but Nok was as common a name in Thailand as Smith was in
England.  
'Mmmm. What's her problem?' I asked.  
'She's getting threatening texts.'  
'On her mobile?'  
'Where else?' she said going for the half smirk.  
'Okay sis, just testing the water,' I joked, then more seriously. 'Did she try
to text him or her back?'  
'And phone him but he doesn't answer.'  
'It's a man then. Does she know him?'  
'She thinks it is her ex-boyfriend.'  
'What does she want me to do?'  
A knock came at the door. We both looked up and a woman walked in. She wore a
white shirt tucked into a black tight fitting skirt. Sewn no her left shirt
pocket was the familiar dark blue badge of Dhurakitpundit University or DPU.  
'Well, here she is. Why don't we ask her?'  
I guessed she was in her early twenties. She proffered her limp hand towards
me.  
'This is Nok,' Lydia said as we both stood. I went to shake her hand but she
pulled away too quickly that I only managed to shake her fingers.  
'Please take a seat,' I said pointing at the only other vacant chair. Her skin
was very light that had me wondering if she weren't Eurasian. She was
beautiful enough. Even under this dull florescent light her jet-black hair
shorn that even Jim Thompson if he were still around, would have had trouble
finding black silk with equal sheen. She was a goddess even by Thai standards.
She smiled a smile that most would find hard to match and sat down. I did my
best that earned me a knowing look from Lydia.  
'I hear you have boyfriend trouble,' I asked in a measured tone.  
'Yes, he send bad text, me no like him but he still love me,' she said
lingering on love me in a low sensual voice that left me a little breathless
or at leased that's how it sounded to me.  
Regaining my wits I asked, 'I see but how can I help you?'  
'He says he no send but I know is him,' she said in earnest.  
'It's going to be difficult to prove.'  
'He put this under my door. I got four,' she said putting four folded A5 sized
pieces of paper on to the desk. I picked one up to read but it was typed in
Thai. I looked up.  
'He say he going to hurt me if I don't stop see other man,' she said taking a
tissue from a small black bag that hung from her shoulder. She gently dabbed
at the corner of her left eye.  
'How were they delivered?'  
'Under her door,' Lydia put in; reminding us she was still there.  
'Oh thanks Lydia, was you there?' I asked sarcastically. She chose to ignore
me, and then to Nok I asked. 'Did you see the messenger?'  
'No, it alway come at night.'  
'I see.'  
'I very scared. I not know what to do. I scared he may hurt me.'  
'Don't worry, he's not going to hurt you,' Lydia said sympathetically and then
to me. 'Is he?'  
I ignored her. 'What nights are they delivered?'  
'Any night,' she said biting her bottom lip in concentration. I still couldn't
see what I could do, but then she added. 'But they seem to come on busy
nights.'  
'There's not a lot I can do about the text but....'  
'Can't you wait outside her apartment block to catch him?' interrupted Lydia.  
'Thanks sis but I think I'll take it from here,' I told her but not giving her
a chance to retaliate I asked Nok. 'When are your busiest nights?'  
'Fridays and Saturdays, it's when students like to sing.'  
  
Late Friday night I sat outside Nok's apartment block in an old Peugeot that
should have been crushed years ago. Its air-con' had just packed up so I sat
there in a pool of sweat with the windows down. The white washed walls of the
block were made up of one-roomed apartments. I knew them well. It's where I
used to stay when I first taught at DPU. The rooms were small but still shared
by whole families or by as many as 6/7 students trying to keep costs down. I
heard a shout and a baby crying from one of the apartments. A sudden blast of
hot air came up from beneath a passing bus. I gagged and reached for a bottle
of water that was well past its sell by date but at least its stale taste was
wet.  
I took out a photo of Dare that Nok had given me to recognise her ex-bow but
she needn't have bothered. I knew him. Dare by name, dare by nature. I taught
him last year. I don't normally recognise past students but this guy was a
real pain. If I told him once I told him a hundred times to turn his mobile
phone off in class. He was an arrogant bugger that didn't give a dam. He was a
big good-looking guy, bigger than the average Thai. No wonder Nok fell for him
but he didn't seem the type to get too smitten with any one particular girl.
For what I could remember there were always half a dozen female groupies
hanging around him. But then again Nok was no ordinary girl.  
About an hour later it began to rain. I was just winding up the windows when I
spotted the unmistakable gate of Dare as he marched passed my car with two
others heading for the apartments. I locked the car and followed them into the
courtyard.  
The singing was just getting started. There were about two-dozen students
sitting around tables beneath some trees that separated this block from the
next; most still wore their black and white DPU uniforms. I tried to keep out
of sight but being white wasn't ideal for a camouflage. After a few minutes
two of them came up behind me and asked me to join them.  
Some of them recognised me as having taught at DPU and asked what I was doing
here. It was a tricky question and told them I liked to listen to them
singing. This went down very well and was then asked if I would like to sing.
I declined with the excuse of a sore throat. They smiled at my peccadillo and
continued as though I wasn't there, which more than suited me. I tried not to
notice Dare as hard as he tried not to notice at me but as I say, he was a
real pain in my class and he knew it.  
'Hey Jake, how are you?' a familiar voice asked.  
I looked up in surprise. 'Fine.'  
'I tried to call. A few teachers are going to the Cowboy bar this coming
Saturday.'  
'Yeh, sorry about that. I've a new phone and I've been too busy to give out
the new number.'  
'Okay but what are you doing here?'  
'I err...'  
'He likes our singing,' one of the students piped up.  
'You do?' Samart asked incredulously manoeuvring his great bulk beside me.
Samart was one of the good guys. He was an engineer who used to work in the UK
before coming back to teach at DPU. He could think like a westerner that made
my reason for being here, even more odd. Why would a foreigner want to listen
to a bunch of drunken out of tune students sing?  
'I'm on a job,' I said quickly deciding to bring Samart in on it.  
He narrowed his eyes. 'A job?'  
'Not really a job but a favour.'  
The music started again that I motioned him to follow me, which he did
willingly. Out of earshot of the others I told him exactly why I was there.  
'I see,' he said thoughtfully.  
'So what do you think?' I asked.  
Samart became thoughtful and then remarked. 'She could be right,' and then in
an almost perfect Essex accent that made me smile. 'Dare can be a bit of a
rough diamond.'  
'Too true,' I laughed.  
'And yes, I believe he is more than capable.' Samart said gravely.  
I broke off when I noticed Dare getting up and heading off. 'Sorry, I've got
to go but thanks.'  
'Not at all but if you need help just let me know.'  
'Thanks again I will,' I said turning away. I followed Dare out of the
courtyard. He looked to be leaving but then changed his mind. He suddenly
nipped up the staircase to the left. I followed him and sure enough he stopped
on Nok's floor. He paused outside her door. He then shot a glance in my
direction and although I was in the shadows I think he knew I was there. What
ever he was going to do he must have change his mind. Turning away from me he
continued walking to the far end and down the stairs. I didn't see him slip
anything under her door but I decided to check all the same.  
He left nothing. Perhaps I was a bit too quick. I should have given him more
time. She thanked me with eyes heavy with sleep. She looked beautiful and
asked her if she was okay. She said she was. I told her to phone me if she had
any problems. I paused hoping she was going to ask me in for a cup of coffee
but she didn't and I left. What was I thinking?  
On the way out I paused to say good-bye but Samart, having charm in abundance
was too busy enjoying him self sat between two of the more mature lady
students. I left him to it.  
I woke up the next morning feeling I had a good night's sleep. I was just
about to shower when the phone went.  
'Hello.'  
'Sorry Mr Jake but I have another note. It came last night just after you
left.'  
'You should have called.'  
'I not want to disturb you.'  
'Never mind, I have an idea.'  
  
I chose a table as close to the road as I dare. From here not only could I see
the café across the road where Nok sat but also, I could see the approaches
from east and west. If Dare came within spitting distance I would be sure to
spot him. After failing in my attempt to thwart further unwanted attentions I
was determined not to let her down this time.  
Nok text her stalker and surprisingly, he text back agreeing to meet her. It
was nearly 6pm and with just a few minutes to go Nok's moments became jerky. I
could see she wasn't relaxed. I surveyed the area, Dare was nowhere to be
seen. At five past six Nok looked over in despair. At six fifteen and after a
second cup of tea I made my way over.  
'Sorry Nok,' I said simply. There was not much I could say. She looked tired;
worn out from the anticipation.  
'It's not your fault,' she said holding out her mobile phone to me. The
bastard had text her that he couldn't make it.  
  
  
The Cowboy Bar or at least that's what I called it was a horseshoe shaped bar
surrounded with tables and chairs. The whole place was made of wood and smelt
of sawdust and stale beer. The band played Hotel California, a popular Thai
favourite. A cool welcoming blast of aircon' greeted us as we walked in.
Walking between feet tapping Thais sitting on wooden benches we joined Lydia
at the bar.  
'Hi ya cowboy,' greeted Lydia warmly. 'Any luck?'  
'No show,' I said taking the beer Lydia bought for me.  
'Sorry you didn't catch your man.'  
'No matter, maybe next time,' Nok said smiling and perkier than I would have
given her credit for.  
The bar began to fill. It was a popular haunt for the more prosperous DPU
students.  
Just then A PINK sounded from Nok's phone. She took it from her bag and looked
at it. Her face turned white. 'He wants to meet me tomorrow, same place, same
time,' she said looking at me. I shook my head in disbelief.  
'Who does this guy think he is?' Lydia said angrily.  
'Quick give me the phone I'll phone him back,' I said almost snatching the
phone from her. It rang twice before it was switched off. 'Bastard,' I said
under my breath. I then punched the stalker's number into my own phone.  
'When you get another text I want you to phone me straight away. It doesn't
matter what time of the day or night, just phone. Nok agreed. Just then Dare
and a group of fellow students walked through the door. Nok looked disturbed
and decided she had quite enough excitement for one night and decided to go
home. Lydia offered to drive her home, which she accepted. Spotting a table
surround by DPU teachers I told the girls I'd hang about for a bit longer. I
joined them just as Samart had finished telling them a joke.  
'Hi Jake, come and sit down,' he beamed. I did but was careful not to loose
sight of Dare. My phone went. It was Lydia who having just found out that Dare
was here, warned me not to do anything stupid. I assured her I wouldn't. Not
too stupid anyway.  
The karaoke started with someone doing a rendition of "Hotel California."
Samart's charm and the help of a few beers made the time to pass pleasantly
that I had forgotten why I was there. After a few more songs Dare took to the
stage and sang another Eagle's number entitled "One of These Nights" Samart
disappeared to the bar and I sat listening to Dare. He could sing all right. A
few minutes later Samart came back with the beer. I was just reaching for the
beer when my phone went again; it was Nok to tell me she had just received
another text. It wasn't Dare as he was just coming down off the stage. I
pressed memory and rang what I hoped was the stalker's number. Maybe not
recognising the number, he may answer it. It rang and continued to do so
without answer. Samart put his beer down and casually pulled out his throbbing
phone, looked at the number and switched it off. My phone rang off too. He
then put it back into his pocket.
