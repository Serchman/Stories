Angela's heart was racing, like a trapped bird trying to flee from its
everlasting cage, she felt like an oncoming panic attack was about to come,
and she tried her hardest to swallow the thickening bile that was rising
through her.  
The two moments with the young boy was playing through her head over and over
again, the creepy smile, over, and over again, what bothered Angela was how
the writing was taken of the wall so cleanly in no time whatsoever, and how
the child could of wondered past so many people un-noticed without been
suspected of anything, even a wondering that the child might of been lost.

Angela thought back, she was only out of an abusive two year relationship, and
ever since then, things seemed to be getting worse and worse, she was slowly
starting to hate her life and the people who surrounded her in her daily
routine. How a breast check up suddenly turned into the start of a living
nightmare for her, and she hoped it would end soon.

"Mrs?" The police officer asked Angela.  
"I'm afraid not," She sighed. "Miss Maton."  
"What did you see and hear?" The police officer asked causally, it seemed that
the bitter life of police work made people like him accustomed to grisly
murder scenes and vile crimes such as these, integrated into their life simply
such as eating a meal or taking the kids to the park.  
"I..." She began, "I only came in for a routine breast check, when this little
kid across from me started to stare at me, grinning, and smiling. The doctor
called me, and I walked down to his office, when I entered the room, the
lights were of, and I felt something move past me, fast, almost...not human."
She looked down at her shoes, trying to catch her breath and steady her rising
heartbeat, the problem grew worse and worse the more she talked and tried to
remember every detail of what happened.  
The police man nodded, gesturing for her to continue her story as the other
police officers bustled around looking at the walls and body of the doctor,
forensics would be here soon, and it would be necessary for everybody,
including Angela to evacuate the room, and most likely take a journey down to
the police station.  
  
"I know where most things are in this room, when I turned on the light, the
doctor was just there, I could tell by blood pumping out through the wounds
inflicted on him that the heart was still beating and he was stabbed just
seconds before I entered the room, on the wall, just over there." She pointed
to above the doctor’s lifeless body. "Were the words, "Turn of the light, I'm
still here." I just did it, I didn't feel anything move past me after that,
then...I turned the light on, the previous writing was gone, and replaced by
"Good girl, you did as I said, the good doctor cannot see you now, good bye."  
Angela shivered; again, the thoughts replaying in her head were to blame.  
"Now that writings gone, and replaced by that!" She pointed to the wall, a
silent tear running smoothly down her beautiful cheek.  
"OK, that’s all we need to know, judging by the writing on the wall, the
killer is watching you, maybe he is bluffing, maybe he isn't, but still, we're
going to advise that you stay in a motel tonight, a squad car will be placed
outside the motel you choose, and we'll provide protection, anything else that
you can remember, even the slightest detail will aid in this investigation,
but a lot of people are going to doubt a kid that young was involved."  
Angela sighed. "I know, that’s the problem, I'm not saying I'm sure it was
him, I'm just saying, it is suspicious."  
"I know we're going to interview all the people that were present in the
waiting room; we've already questioned two of them who wouldn't stray from
here. Apparently an old woman said the boy was looking up and smiling at her,
and when she smiled back, he frowned, and kept frowning. Could just be a
pretty average kid thing."  
"Yeah, I suppose so..." Angela said, digging in her pocket to make sure she
had a cigarette; god knew she needed one right about now when she got outside.  
Outside the sound of a car and a van parking was heard, forensics was here.  
"Miss Maton, we're going to have to ask you to evacuate the room, we have to
go as well, this way, please."  
  
The police officer, his name was James, was kind to Angela, offering to drive
her to a pretty decent motel where she could rest her head, Angela didn't
drive, she could, just didn't bother with it, so she gratefully accepted his
offer. His short black hair and high cheekbones were dazzling her as he
uttered every word.  
"We'll be out here all night, don't worry, try and get some sleep and maybe a
few details might come back to you."  
It was raining outside, rained bashed of the windscreen, in a way, Angela
found this relaxing, she always loved the rain bashing of the window at night
when she was about to fall asleep, picturing how she would be warm and snugly
under a large blanket while outside was miserable and cold.  
"James? If I can call you that" Angela said.  
"Yeah, what is it?" He said with a smile on his face. Something allured and
attracted Angela to this man; his kindness and different personality were
soothing to her.  
"Thank you," She clasped a hand around his, knowing that this was totally
inappropriate, but so irresistible only an two hours and this man was starting
to have a vulnerable effect on her, and one thing Angela prided herself on
lately was not been sucked in by men, not exposing herself, keeping a hard
outer shell where no bastard could find her, or break the walls she had
irreversibly surrounded herself with, but this time, it was different, it was
like her body was on auto-pilot, her hand had simply clasped with his without
realizing it. "Just for everything," She smiled.  
James smiled back. "It’s OK, no problem." He nervously scratched the back of
his head; attraction between the two adults had begun. "I...uh....let me walk
you to reception, an umbrella is in the trunk, don't want you getting soaked
before you go to bed."  
Angela smiled yet again, she couldn't remember the last time she smiled this
often, this man was so genuinely kind and generous, and was the type of man
she always wanted in her life.  
"Sure, that'd be great, James."  
  
They exited the car, rain teaming down on the large umbrella as the sounds of
laughter from James making jokes enveloped the gloomy, wet night, for a half
hour Angela had forgotten about what had just happened, almost as if the
doctor had not been murdered, as if it was just a normal day, with a random
romantic encounter.

Angela got her room at reception, and with only her shoes and trousers wet,
she looked forward to getting some sleep.  
"Alright," James said, "I'll be outside if you need anything whatsoever, I'll
leave the umbrella here, just in case, don't want you coming to me soaked,
you'll wreck my squad car," He laughed and Angela smiled. "Listen,” James
turned around slightly, just as he went towards the door, " I won't let
anything happen you, I'll see you bright and early, OK?"  
Angela nodded. "Thank you, so much."  
James nodded, and left the room, leaving Angela to think about this newfound
attraction which seemed to be getting deeper by the minute for this man, and
then the scenes of the doctor been murdered, the young boy, and the mother not
suspecting anything, the whole day had been a flurry of pain, trauma and bad
full stop.  
  
She fell asleep after an hour of tossing and turning, then lightning struck,
waking her from a light slumber as the flash beamed for a split second through
the window.  
  
On the wall, across from her bed, was writing, her heart started to race once
again as all colour drained from her face.  
  
"You're right, I'm not human, Angie."
