**** Intro:** Max Speed is a Private Eye sent on a simple security assignment in sunny Florida. Things start to go wrong when three of Speed's colleagues are murdered.

The other players thought I was bluffing. I turned over the King and the Jack
for a Royal Flush and watched their faces crumble. The pot was about two
thousand dollars, give or take. Not bad for a nights work. I dragged the money
pile over the table and flashed the other guys a smile.  
"Pleasure doing business with you, boys," I quipped.  
I stuffed the cash into a money belt I always used at card games but felt
uncomfortable with the way some weasel faced guy was staring at me from the
other side of the room. My senses went to red alert. I knew trouble was
approaching at a sprint.  
"Hey, I know you!" wailed the Weasel. "You're that Private Eye guy, Dick
Speed."  
"It's Max Speed, dickhead," I hit back.  
"Whatever your God damn name is," Weasel jumped up with a mean look. "You got
me sacked from my job at the ship yard."  
Weasel looked vaguely familiar. I'd probably found him with his hand in the
safe or someone else's wallet. Over the years I'd caught thousands of petty
criminals like Weasel. They were small minded guys who couldn't stick to a
regular job without resorting to stealing. These guys were generally not very
smart but occasionally dangerous.  
"I've heard of you," another guy said from the other side of the room. "Max
Speed? That's your name, right?"  
I nodded and didn't like where this was heading. This other guy had been crap
at cards but was a menacing presence and had the look of a 1930's gangster. He
came slowly closer.  
"I heard this guy cheats at cards. He ripped off someone I know from the Lower
East Side."  
I couldn't argue, sometimes I did revert to cheating. Somehow I had to talk
myself out of a rolling snowball of a situation.  
"A cheat huh? I bet the bastards been cheating all night," another guy
seethed. "Let's get him!" There were murmurs of agreement all round.  
Weighing up my situation, I counted twelve other guys in the room. Not the
greatest of odds. These guys ranged from 200 lb heavyweights to lightweights
like Weasel and fast becoming a lynch mob. I clipped the money belt to my
waist and glanced around the room for an escape route. The card game took
place in the office of an old run down warehouse in South Bronx. Not the
safest place to be after dark. I'd heard two guys talking in a bar and turned
up for the game without an invitation. Not the smartest move I'd ever made but
these guys were hopeless players. It was easy money. They moved closer and
formed a semi circle around me.  
Weasel produced a knife from his jacket. "I'm going to stick you and gut you
like a fish." I knew he meant it.  
If I didn't do something quickly I'd end up floating face down in the Harlem
River. There was a window behind me so I had two choices, stand still and be
gutted by Weasel or the second option, try to escape. I chose the latter.  
As the mob closed in I stood up and picked up the chair. The nearest guy
hesitated and recoiled, thinking I was going to whack him. This gave me a
brief second to whirl the chair around and heave it through the window. Glass
tinkled and shattered along with the old wooden frame. Whilst the others stood
in a moment of shock, I didn't waste any time. I ran a few paces and dived
head first through the wrecked window.  
In my haste I failed to observe what lay on the other side of the warehouse
window. I briefly hoped it wasn't a main road or a railway track. Luckily it
was neither. I rolled down a huge pile of garbage. I bumped into an old
fridge, went head over heels through a pile of old rotting carpets, broken
bottles and black bags of rank stinking mush. When I came to a halt I stood up
and looked back to the warehouse. I saw Weasel and a few others climbing
through the broken window in pursuit.  
I turned and stumbled through the darkness trying to get my bearings. Weasel
and the others shouted insults and threats as they descended the rancid trash
heap. The cold winter wind whistled through me as I looked for a way out of
the compound. An eight foot, rusty wire fence ran round the perimeter of the
warehouse grounds. I found a section that sagged and lurched over the top and
out of the compound. I heard Weasel and the others still following behind.  
South Bronx was a long way from where I lived. Navigation was difficult in the
dark. I knew I was near East 149th Street, in the Mott Haven area, not far
from the Yankees Stadium. I'd taken the tube from Manhattan up to the Bronx
and now I was lost. The streets were deserted with the inhabitants tucked away
from the biting cold in their old brown brick apartments.  
I started a steady jog and glanced behind me. Weasel and his cronies still
followed and I was alarmed to see the mob had swollen in numbers. Where were
all these psychos coming from? The horde gathered pace behind me, chanting and
shouting. I twisted and turned down back alleys and narrow streets trying to
put some distance between us. Most of the gang were familiar with the area and
I knew they would try and surround me.  
The only thing I wanted now was a scotch and a cigarette. I ran behind some
old red brick buildings and saw a railway track to my left. A main road ran
straight ahead in the distance.  
My lungs felt ready to burst. Sweat dripped from my forehead despite the cold.
I crashed through a wooden fence and the street sign told me I was on Park
Avenue. I put my head down and kept running. I didn't dare look around as I
heard the sounds of the mob closing in.  
A yellow cab stopped in the distance. The passenger stumbled out like he was
drunk. I put in an extra spurt of energy.  
"Please don't drive away," I yelled, even though they had no chance of hearing
me.  
I neared the taxi and took a peek behind me. Weasel and his mob were bearing
down on me with the look of hungry wolves. I heard raised voices when I came
within yards of the cab. The driver and passenger seemed to be in the middle
of an argument over the fare. I opened the door and threw myself in the back.  
"Hey," the driver jumped in surprise. "I ain't ready to take another fare
yet."  
"Just drive," I screeched. "Look, I'll pay his fare. Whatever he owes you I'll
pay, just drive, God damn it!"  
The driver caught site of the baying mob in his rear view mirror.  
"Oh shit!" he wailed and banged his foot on the accelerator.  
The yellow cab lurched forward leaving the confused passenger still arguing
with the night air. Weasel and his rabble erupted in fury that their prey had
escaped. I turned in the back seat and in between gasps gave Weasel and his
mates the finger.  
"Tough shit, assholes," I yelled. Their replies were drowned out by the noise
of the cab.  
"So, where do you want to go?" asked the driver. He was a huge black guy
sporting a slightly worried look. His license said his name was Francis Lemon.  
"Francis, take me to Brooklyn Heights, my friend. A friendly neighborhood."  
  
I went to work the next day with a big smile on my face. Sometimes it works
out lucky, you win and you get away with it.  
"Mr. Kroll wants to see you, Max," Becky, the gorgeous secretary informed me
as I sauntered into the office.  
"Mr. Kroll wants to see me?" I was quite surprised.  
The company had undergone a few changes recently. My old boss Marvin Carter
had sold the Private Investigation business to the mysterious Mr. Victor Kroll
who seemed to know lots of rich, well to do and important people. He must have
known someone important as the company was now globally licensed. From
snippets I'd heard he was ex-military and ex-government security. The company
now dealt in security operations as well as private investigations. There
seemed to be lots of CIA wannabe guys walking around in shades and wearing
suits and ear pieces, muttering into small microphones. They came and went
without any conversation.  
I didn't know what to expect when I knocked on Victor Kroll's door. I'd seen
him briefly but hadn't spoken to him. Becky, the secretary had dished out my
assignments whilst Mr. Kroll had been in charge. I'd just put my head down and
carried on as normal.  
"Enter," came a cry from inside the office.  
I tentatively opened the door and went in. Victor Kroll sat behind his desk
opposite a huge bear of a man with a pony tail who looked like he'd been tire
ironed into his suit.  
"Ah, Max Speed, I presume," Kroll barked with the tone of a drill instructor.
He nodded to the big guy. "Okay, Will, can you give us a minute?"  
The big man nodded, rose slowly from the chair and shuffled towards the door.
I navigated my way around him to Kroll's desk.  
"Sit down, Speed," Kroll instructed and gestured towards the chair. "We
haven't met properly, I know. I've been too God damn busy trying to sort out
this mess Carter left me." His voice was loud and sounded like he regularly
gargled with gravel and bourbon.  
I had the impression that Victor Kroll was one of those people who says that
"there aren't enough hours in the day." He had the look of an ex-military rank
with short, cropped graying hair, lean, trim build and steely blue eyes that
glared intently. He wore a dark green suit that hung on him immaculately.  
"Carter informed me that you and he didn't see eye to eye. Is that correct?"
Kroll's sturdy gaze narrowed and bore down on me closely. I felt like I was
being interrogated. Sweat trickled down my back and I felt my face redden.  
"Well, err...no, sir. We didn't hit it off. I think we were just two different
kinds of..."  
"Good, I'm glad you didn't get along. Carter was a weak man and one thing I
can't have is feeble individuals on my team." Kroll stood up and paced the
room with his hands behind his back as he talked, like he was lecturing a
bunch of military officers.  
I sat bolt upright in the chair staring face forward hardly daring to blink.
This guy was totally intimidating. I felt like an 18 year old recruit on some
parade ground.  
"Are you a military man, Speed?" Kroll spun around on his heels, his voice
slightly softer.  
"I did a couple of years in the Navy, years ago, sir but..."  
"I knew it!" Kroll smiled. "I can always tell a military man from a civilian.
That asshole Carter wouldn't know one end of a rifle from another." Kroll
shook his head and seemed to be lost within his own thoughts for a moment.  
It seemed a bizarre situation that I spent years trying to avoid Marvin Carter
and here was my new boss agreeing with me that he was a complete asshole. The
thing was I never felt intimidated by Carter, even when I messed up. I dreaded
the thought of receiving a dressing-down from Victor Kroll.  
"Carter told me that you didn't do things properly, you cut corners. Is that
true?"  
I felt myself shrinking again. Even though I was forty years old I felt like I
was back in basic military training.  
"I always tried to get the best result I could," I stammered.  
"Exactly, that's right!" Kroll boomed. "That's why I like you, Speed."  
I experienced an inward sigh of relief on hearing those words.  
"Assholes like Carter wouldn't understand that sometimes we have to play dirty
to get results. We can't always do what the field manual says," he nodded.  
Even when he praised me up, I felt edgy.  
"Have you ever been to Miami, Speed?"  
The question threw me for a second. "No, but I've been to Orlando to..."  
"Okay, you'll love it there. I'm going to send you down there to do a little
job." Kroll never let me finish my sentence. "We're doing the security for a
friend's daughters wedding in Miami Beach. My guy in Florida is Antonio Gomez;
he'll show you the ropes and demonstrate how we work security. It'll be a nice
job to ease you in. It can be a bit different to private investigations, you
know."  
I hadn't actually agreed to go to Miami but did I have a choice? Anyhow, I
figured a few days in the sun away from the New York winter would do me good.
A wedding where there might be some rich single women and maybe a game of
cards would materialize.  
  
We flew from JFK to Miami International airport the following morning. I
traveled with two company goons that were as ignorant as they were up their
own asses. They were called Carlton and Freddy and from what they said I
assumed they were regularly sent to Florida. We touched down at Miami
International around lunchtime.  
Kroll's man Antonio Gomez met us at the airport and drove us to our motel on
Miami Beach. The Lemon Grove Motel was near the Bay Harbor Islands where the
wedding was taking place the following day. I dumped my bag in the room and
quickly found the bar. I sat outside and ordered a beer. The sun was bright
and the sea and sky clear blue like in a holiday brochure. The palm trees
swayed in the warm gentle breeze in front of the pastel lime green and pink
buildings. I put on my shades and took in a deep breath of salty sea air and
savored the warm sun on my face.  
An hour later, Antonio Gomez drove us to the plush Maritime Hotel where the
wedding ceremony was taking place the next day. He briefed us on the security
arrangements, where to go, what to do and at what time. It all seemed straight
forward enough. The reception and function rooms looked magnificent as
decorators, planners and staff rushed around adding final touches. I couldn't
help wondering how much all this was costing Kroll's pal. The father of the
bride was probably spending more than I earned in a lifetime.  
I left Gomez, Carlton and Freddy talking shop and found my way to the outside
beach bar. I ordered a margarita and lit a cigarette. I wondered how many card
games it would take me to afford a vacation in the Maritime Hotel. Half way
through my drink and smoke, Gomez and the other two arrived on the scene.  
"Hey, what are you doing, Speed?" Carlton snorted. "Are you some kind of
stinking drunk or something?"  
"Just relaxing," I murmured.  
"You're drinking on duty and I don't like smokers, period."  
"Who rattled your cage?" Carlton was annoying me now.  
He was a typical ex-military type who thought the world owed him a living. If
he was that good he'd still be in the military. Freddy stood next to him
glowering and tried to look intimidating.  
"You are the weak link in the team," he hissed.  
"I'm not the one causing a scene." I noticed a few staff and passers by double
taking Carlton's rant.  
"Okay guys, let's be cool," Gomez intervened. "We don't want any ructions in
camp, all right?" He was tall, thin and Hispanic and looked like he'd just
walked off the set of Miami Vice.  
I shrugged and nodded. "It's only one drink."  
"Right, one drink and you'll have a clear head for tomorrow, okay?" Gomez
nodded.  
"Of course," I necked back the rest of the margarita. I didn't understand what
the big deal was. I mean how hard could it be to supervise a bunch of half
drunken party guests?  
"You better be on the ball tomorrow, Speed. That's all I can say," Carlton
chipped in.  
"The wedding tomorrow is the daughter of Bob Arrowmint," Gomez said it like I
should know the name.  
I shook my head. "I've never heard of Bob Spearmint," I said the name wrong on
purpose. Carlton shook his head, Freddy put his hand over his eyes and Gomez
looked exasperated. I think I'd done a good job of pissing them all off.  
"Bob Arrowmint is an ex-politician. He is a very rich and powerful man," Gomez
explained as though he was talking to a simpleton.  
"Right, got it," I laughed.  
"Don't fuck this up, Speed," Carlton hissed.  
"I won't," I smiled and flicked my cigarette into the exclusive fish pond
causing Gomez, Carlton and Freddy to cringe yet again.  
  
We ate our evening meal back at the motel and managed not to have any
arguments or cross words. Gomez did most of the talking with his tales of the
high life in Miami. I wondered if he was such a high roller, why was he
staying with us in the motel? He said he lived further up the coast and was
too far to drive. Carlton and Freddy chipped in with some anecdotes of their
own and thought they were hilariously amusing. I sat in silence most of the
evening, wishing I hadn't come to Florida for this job at all.  
A little after nine, Gomez invited us back to his room to watch some DVDs of
his boat. Carlton and Freddy went but I declined saying I needed an early
night. Seeing as they all seemed to be teetotal, non card players, I thought
I'd find another source of amusement elsewhere. Gomez told me to be ready to
go at 0730 in the morning.  
I felt like a 10th grade kid playing hooky from high school as I crept out of
the parking lot into the freedom of the night. I took a cab down to the South
Beach area with all the watering holes and clubs and was drawn into a
particular neon lit bar playing Surf Rock beats, my kind of music. That was
the start of a great night, from what I remember. There was hazy neon infested
recollections of bars, nightclubs and rounded off with a visit to a casino
somewhere. Then there was the cute Cuban girl.  
The first thing I felt was my eyes stinging from the bright morning sunlight.
The second thing was the smooth warm body of the Cuban girl lying in bed next
to me. Then I wondered where the hell I was. A peek at my watch told me I was
already late.  
"Oh, shit!" I yelled. "Not today."  
Crumpled dollar bills lay scattered around the small bedroom amongst both our
sets of clothes. I hurriedly dressed and desperately tried to remember the
girl's name. It was no good, I couldn't recall. She carried on sleeping and
didn't stir. I gathered up the dollar bills and stuffed them in my pockets. I
didn't have time to count the money but obviously had won a good amount.  
I virtually fell down the stairs of the apartment block and out into the
street. The morning traffic and people moved slowly by. My hangover kicked in
when I squinted in the bright sunlight. The street was alive with color and
filled with art deco buildings. I remembered it was Ocean Drive but it looked
very different in the daylight.  
A glance at my watch brought on another wave of nausea. It was 0740; I was
already ten minutes late. Luckily, an empty cab crept along the road in front
of me. I shouted and waved some dollar bills in the air.  
"Take me to the Lemon Grove Motel, fast," I snapped and jumped in the back of
the cab.  
"I'll go as quick as I can, boss," the cab driver retorted.  
The early morning traffic was slow moving. I kept glancing at my watch twice
every minute. I imagined Gomez, Carlton and Freddy waiting and cursing me
twice every minute. Sweat ran down my temple and I thought I was going to
hurl. Last nights cocktails were trying to surface again. Why didn't I have
that early night instead?  
The time was a little after 8am when the cab swung into the motel parking lot.
I felt relieved to see Gomez's 4x4 still in its space. The hasty excuse that
I'd gone out for an early morning walk and become lost was the feeble plan I'd
try to stick to. I knew they wouldn't believe me. Mainly because I wore night
time clothes, stunk of alcohol and looked like shit.  
The door to Gomez's room was slightly ajar when I crept uncomfortably over
from the parking lot. I desperately wanted a cigarette but didn't have any
more time to waste. The morning news blared from the TV inside. I gave the
door a slight knock and thought I better make my apologies early.  
"I'm sorry I'm late guys. You're not going to believe what happened to me this
morning. When you said about having a clear head, well, I had a few vodkas in
my room last night so I went out for a walk this morning and..." my words
trailed off.  
The door slowly swung open and Carlton lay on his back two yards inside the
room. He had a round bullet hole in the middle of his forehead and his eyes
stared up at nothing. A few more holes had pierced his chest and a circle of
blood on the carpet surrounded him.  
Freddy sat at the table with his head slumped on his chest and a bullet hole
in his right temple. The exit wound had caused a splattering of blood and
brains on the wall to his left.  
Panic and nausea hit me in equal measure. I noticed a pair of feet lying in
the kitchenette. I moved cautiously through the main room and saw Gomez in the
same predicament as Carlton. He lay on his back with bullet holes in his chest
and one in the forehead.  
The urge to vomit hit me like a house brick. I moved to the sink but saw
Gomez's flip up cell phone by the drainage hole. He must have been making a
call when he was gunned down. I quickly picked it up and emptied the contents
of my stomach into the sink.  
A cigarette was priority. I found a crumpled packet in my pants pocket with
three cigarettes inside. Two were broken and one was bent but still usable. I
lit it without a thought about the non smoking room law.  
My head spun as I stumbled into the reception area and called the local cops.
They quickly arrived on the scene led by Detective Amos, a stern looking,
older black guy who questioned me with apprehension. I knew about crime scenes
and realized I probably had contaminated the area. Maybe that was why Amos was
so pissed at me. He grilled me for a second time and told me not to leave
Miami for a few days as I was a natural suspect.  
I called Victor Kroll and explained the situation. He brushed it off and
talked about casualties of war. He was more concerned with the fact he was
three guys short for the security assignment for the wedding. I'd completely
forgotten about the bash at the Maritime Hotel. Kroll promised me he'd have
three more security men at the Hotel in time for the wedding and that I was
now in charge. I put the phone down and felt completely shattered.  
Kroll was as good as his word. Three guys turned up at the Hotel five minutes
before the guests were due to arrive. Where he got them from I couldn't guess.
I reluctantly briefed them, even though I didn't have much of a clue myself.  
The wedding ceremony and the reception went smoothly without a glitch. I
smiled at all the right times and was on my best behavior even though I really
didn't want to be there. I couldn't shake the image of the three dead guys out
of my head. I'd seen stiffs before but this had the hallmarks of a brutal
contract slaying. One bullet to the head and a few pumped into the chest.  
Around midnight the guests started to disperse to their rooms. I was surprised
when a tall, sturdy guy with gray slick hair and fake tan came towards me and
offered a hand shake.  
"Hi, nice work from you and your boys tonight," he boomed with a Southern
accent and showed perfect bright white teeth. "Sorry, the name's Bob
Arrowmint, father of the bride." He was immaculately dressed in a cream tuxedo
and bootlace tie.  
I returned the handshake and nearly cried in pain at Arrowmint's vice like
grip. He had the fixed smile and air of a politician and I imagined him saying
things like 'I'm just a man of the people,' in that unmistakable southern
drawl.  
"Say, I was sorry to hear about that fellow Gomez this morning. I didn't know
the guy but Victor told me he was a good man. Have you any further news from
the police?"  
I shook my head. "No, just a hard time from Detective Amos."  
"He sure does like to bust balls. I'll give him that!" Arrowmint laughed.
"Listen, when you boys knock off in a moment, come over to the bar for some
champagne, on me." Arrowmint gave his man of the people grin again.  
"We'll be there." I returned a weak smile.  
Thirty minutes later I acknowledged the all clear from Arrowmint to wind up
for the night. The other security guys were only too happy to guzzle free
champagne with some of the last party stragglers who mainly consisted of
older, single drunken women. My guess was the younger crowd faded away to
South Beach area some time earlier.  
Arrowmint introduced us to his wife who looked like a combination of Joan
Rivers and Bet Midler. For once I didn't feel up to partying even though I had
a tempting offer from a cute waitress called Sally. I drunk one glass of
champagne and decided to call it a night. Tiredness and exhaustion took hold
of me as I said my goodbyes. The other security guys wished me well and Bob
Arrowmint said he'd tell Victor Kroll what a good job I'd done. He gave me his
business card and another crushing handshake.  
On my way out, a large cut glass, cylindrical ash tray caught my attention. It
stood about 2 feet high and had psychedelic colors running through it. I
glanced around; no one was about so I grabbed the ashtray and was surprised
how heavy it was. I staggered out of the hotel and hailed a cab.  
Back at the Lemon Grove Motel I hit the sack and slept like a log. A strange
ringing tone woke me. I checked the bedside clock that flashed 03:08am. It
wasn't the Surf Rock ring tone of my cell or the room phone. I switched on the
bedside lamp and looked around the room. The pants I wore the previous night
lay crumpled on the floor. A light flashed blue from inside the pocket.  
Suddenly I remembered it was Antonio Gomez's cell phone. When I heaved in the
sink in the morning I must have accidentally put the phone in my pocket. This
was evidence from a major crime scene. Amos could throw my ass in jail for
this. I fished the cell out of my pants and looked at the caller i.d. The name
flashing on the screen was Catalina. Was it his wife? From what I gathered
Gomez was a single man and loving every minute of it. The smart thing to have
done would be either hand the phone over to the police or toss it into the sea
and pretend I'd never seen it.  
I did neither, I answered the call.  
"Hello?"  
"Who is this?" replied the female voice in a heavy Hispanic accent. She
obviously knew I wasn't Gomez.  
I didn't know whether to say a false name or my own. My mouth went dry and my
brain wasn't in gear.  
"Dick Weasel," was the pathetic name I came up with.  
"What did you say?" She obviously thought I was either psychotic or into
beastiality.  
"Sorry, it's Max Speed," I stammered. I didn't have the stomach for any more
lying. "I was a colleague of Antonio Gomez."  
"You were there, at the Lemon Grove Motel?" She sounded surprised.  
"I'm still staying here."  
"What? In the same room?"  
"No, not the same room as the slayings, sorry murders. The police have
cordoned it off as a crime scene, no one is allowed in," I explained.  
"You must not stay there anymore. You could be in danger."  
"Well, most people have left. They didn't want to hang around a murder scene.
But I'm a private investigator so these things don't really scare me that..."  
"Does anyone else know you have Antonio's phone?" She butted in.  
"Well, no. To tell you the truth I forgot I had it myself," I admitted.  
"Good, come to Smokey's Club tonight. I need to talk to you."  
"So, who are you Catalina? Where is Smokey's Club? Hello?" The line was dead.
I tried calling back but the cell phone was switched off.  
The situation was flirting with mystery. I stared at Gomez's phone and turned
it over and over in my hand. What the hell was going on? Three contract
slayings. What the hell was Gomez up to and were Carlton and Freddy involved?
How was this mysterious Catalina involved? And who was she? The questions
burned in my mind.  
My private eye persona kicked into gear. I felt awake and alive but I needed
to catch up on some sleep.  
A loud thumping on the door woke me. The room was still in semi darkness, a
glance of the alarm clock told me it was 0628am. I moved quickly but
cautiously to the door and didn't use the spy hole. I'd watched a movie once
where someone looked through a spy hole and the guy on the other side of the
door drilled through into their eye. Not for me, thanks. I kept in the shadows
and peered through the narrow window beside the door.  
An overweight Latino guy with long, dark curly hair and a goatee beard was
rattling the door. I couldn't place him but he didn't strike me as good news.
He went back to his car and brought back a jimmy bar. By the shifty way he
kept looking around I figured he was up to no good. I didn't want him to see
me so I ducked back into the shadows as he approached the door.  
The wooden frame creaked as the Latino intruder took a crack at the door. I
looked out of the window again; the guy still looked around tensely as he
jiggled the jimmy bar into the frame. I saw the butt of a handgun sticking out
the waste band of his jog pants. Things grew more serious.  
At first, I just thought it was a shoddy burglary attempt. Now I knew it was
more than that. The general house breaker or motel thief doesn't come armed. I
looked at the phone, the door began to give. I had no time to make a call let
alone wait for the cops to arrive. This guy was going to break in and shoot me
like Gomez, Carlton and Freddy.  
The door gave a final defiant groan. I looked around for a weapon and saw the
psychedelic cut glass ash tray in front of me. Hauling the ashtray with me, I
darted to the wall behind the door the moment it gave way. The Latino trod
slowly and carefully into the room leading with the pistol. I noticed the gun
was fitted with a silencer. When he crept past the door and entirely in the
room he stopped for a moment. I raised the ash tray above my head and
forcefully brought it down.  
The ashtray disintegrated into a million pieces with a loud shattering and
tinkling. The Latino crumpled to the floor under a hail of psychedelic glass
and spatters of blood. He lay motionless on the carpet. They say smoking kills
but the ashtray I stole just saved my fucking life. I celebrated by lighting a
cigarette.  
The cops, led by Amos, didn't take long to reach the Lemon Grove. They swerved
into the parking lot at break neck speed. Amos jumped out of the squad car
before it had stopped. I stood outside my room trying to look cool and casual.  
"Trouble seems to follow you around, don't it?" Amos growled as he strode into
the motel room, followed by several cops.  
  
An hour later, the mess had finally been cleaned up, the Latino carted off in
an ambulance and the police were happy. Amos cornered me by the doorway.  
"If you're holding out on me with anything I swear I'll haul your ass through
jail," he snarled.  
"What do you mean?" I acted dumb.  
"That piece of shit was no hit man, like you said. He's just some dumb ass
housebreaker sent in to get something from your room." He waited for a reply
that didn't happen. "What kind of self respecting assassin would come waltzing
back into a motel where there's been a multiple homicide the previous day and
then wrench the door open with a jimmy bar, huh?"  
He had a point. "So you don't think it's the same guy who killed Gomez,
Carlton and Freddy?" Those three names seemed to roll off my tongue now.  
"Hell, no. That son of a bitch won't even be in the same God damn state."  
"This goon was sent here to steal something?"  
"Hell, yeah. And if you got in the way, he'd pop a cap in your ass for the
hell of it. That guy was just a local messed up junkie doing a cash job for
his next fix."  
"What was he after?" The only thing I could think off was Gomez's cell phone.  
"You tell me," Amos raised his voice in mock surprise. "You're the guy that
runs all over the place thinking he's Sherlock God damn Holmes, Mister Private
Eye."  
"Sherlock Holmes wasn't technically a private eye," I corrected.  
"Say, what?" Amos was pissed off. "Get this jerk the fuck out of here," he
shouted at a nearby cop. He stomped out of the door into the morning sunlight.  
"Remember, Speed, if you're holding out on me I'm going to whoop your ass," he
called back.  
I thought about telling him about the stolen ash tray but thought better of
it. Amos would probably have arrested me for theft for the hell of it.  
The manager of the Lemon Grove kindly moved me to one of the superior motel
suites. Apart from the bright Florida colors and plastic plants, it was just
the same as far as I could tell. The only difference being a back door through
the kitchenette. I thought the exit could come in handy if any other
housebreaking, Latino assassins came knocking at the front door. Amos left a
patrol car with two dozy cops in the parking lot to mind the place. Really I
should have gone to a different motel but if leads were coming to me then at
least I might get a break in the case.  
I milked the cops in the parking lot for information. They clammed up at first
but as we shot the breeze, my unswerving powers of persuasion made them spill.
The Latino guy was Hector Fernandez, a small time hood who had a rap sheet as
long as a roll of lavatory towels. He had a drug habit and a nasty temper but
he wasn't usually associated with firearms.  
Back in my room I retrieved Gomez's phone. That's what Fernandez must have
been sent to get. There was nothing else involved with the case. I turned it
over in my hand thinking about the late night call from the mysterious
Catalina. I scrolled through recent calls made and received, the saved numbers
and recent text messages. There were several recent calls to Victor Kroll,
Catalina and Bob Arrowmint. There were two calls to Smokey's Club the night
before Gomez was killed.  
Smokey's Club seemed to be the next logical step in the chain. Maybe I could
meet up with Catalina and find out what the hell was going on.  
  
I spent the rest of the morning by the motel pool, I figured what the hell.
Amos didn't want me to leave Miami. I called Kroll to give him an update and
told him I was snooping around a bit. He gave me the green light and said to
find out what I could.  
The motel club house wasn't much more than a lobby but it did have a computer
with internet access. I found Smokey's Club on the local map in Little Havana
on the mainland.  
When the sun started dipping I took a cab to Little Havana via a casino a few
blocks from Smokey's. Bad hands came in abundance but I managed to drag myself
away from the card table before the losses became too heavy. I hoped it wasn't
going to be a bad omen. It felt like I was walking into the lions den without
so much as a shield to defend myself.  
The pink and blue neon lights lit up the name 'Smokey's' outside the club.
Underneath in smaller letters was the logo 'It's Hot!' I wandered if that's
what the welcome would be like for me.  
I made my way inside. The décor resembled a 1930's jazz club and smelled as
though it hadn't been cleaned since the 1930's. Huge fake palms and red velvet
drapes hung from the walls and ceiling. The place was about half full of
tourists, students, low life's and old jazz buffs trying to cling to their
youth. I ordered a pina colada from the cocktail bar and found it surprisingly
good.  
The piped jazz classics suddenly clicked off and a nasal voice boomed out from
the stage. Everyone in the club turned towards the noise and winced at the
whining feedback.  
"Ladies and Gentlemen, please put your hands together for the
marvelous...Catalina!"  
The name caused me to raise an eyebrow. When my eyes met Catalina I was struck
dumb, open mouthed and probably looked totally goofy. She was one of the most
stunningly beautiful women I had ever seen. Jet black hair surrounded her face
and touched on her slender shoulders. Her skin was golden brown and gleamed
against her silver dress. Stunning cobalt blue eyes glinted in the stage
lights and her red lips puckered as she began to sing with the voice of an
angel.  
I felt a jolt in my stomach. Was it the pina colada or was I in love? I necked
back the cocktail and hurriedly ordered another.  
Catalina went through her repertoire of songs. It was all tunes from singers
like Nina Simone and Ella Fitzgerald and every number was on the nail.  
After the set finished I bought an overpriced bottle of champagne and tried to
get backstage. A goon barred the way to her dressing room.  
"Will you tell Catalina that Max Speed is here to see her?" I smiled at the
gorilla.  
He nodded and knocked before sticking his head around the door. I heard him
mumble something before he turned and gestured for me to go inside. All the
while he stared at me with complete contempt. He glanced at the champagne,
huffed and shook his huge head as I squeezed by.  
Catalina sat at a small make up table looking into the mirror and touching up
her mascara. She looked even more beautiful close up.  
"That was a fantastic performance," I muttered. The room suddenly felt hot, I
felt awkward.  
"Thank you, but I sing the same old songs five nights a week," she retorted
with an underlying frostiness.  
"I err...bought you some champagne. I thought we could..."  
"I don't like champagne and anyway I don't drink when I'm working," her blue
eyes fixed on me and I wilted.  
"Right...okay," I felt foolish. Catalina probably had about a thousand guys a
week trying to hit on her but I had to know her connection with Gomez. An
uneasy silence smothered the room. I figured it was time to get into character
and be a hard ass otherwise things would go nowhere.  
"Catalina, you asked me to come here because you said you needed to talk to
me. What's going on?" I dropped the Mr. Nice Guy act.  
"Antonio got into things way over his head," her eyes looked sorrowful. I had
the hunch that the two of them were involved but what she saw in him God only
knew. "If you've still got his cell phone you better get rid of it quickly. He
was involved in certain things he shouldn't have been."  
"What kind of things?" I was curious.  
She was about to answer when the dressing room door opened. A big black guy
that looked like a slimmer version of Barry White stood in the doorway with
the gorilla still on guard behind.  
"Catalina, come on. It's time for the next set," he growled. He stared at me
with the same apprehension that the gorilla had. "Tell your guest that he will
have to leave. Sorry mister...?" He looked at me waiting for an answer.  
"Speed, Max Speed," I replied, reaching out for a handshake. I noticed a flash
of surprise cover the big man's face. "And you are...?"  
"Smokey Cole. It's my club," he reluctantly returned a weak hand shake.
"Catalina has to go."  
The second half of Catalina's act was more upbeat with covers of old Motown
and Soul numbers but still just as good. I continued with the pina coladas and
was enjoying the evening. After she finished I tried to get backstage again.
There was no sign of Catalina, Smokey Cole or the guarding gorilla. The
dressing room door was half open and everything was cleared out. I made my way
out into the street and looked for a cab.  
I heard Gomez's cell phone ringing in my pocket. There was no name or number
displayed.  
"Hello?"  
"Is that Max Speed?" The voice was male.  
"Yeah, who's this?" The line was already dead.  
Whoever killed Gomez was onto me but there was a clue in his phone somewhere.
I found a cab and returned to South Beach. The cops were still outside the
Lemon Grove looking bored and irritated. As I walked by the squad car I held
up the champagne bottle. They waved me away in frustration.  
I put the champagne in the fridge in my room and reached for the bourbon in
the mini bar. In my mind I tried to go over the sequence of events of the case
so far. I kept coming back to the same conclusion that the clue was held in
Gomez's phone. What had he been up to that was so bad?  
The night was still and quiet outside. No robbing assassins came yet. I drank
most of the mini bar as I went through Gomez's cell over and over. Still
nothing jumped out at me. They, whoever they were, must have wanted this cell
badly. I thought about Smokey Cole and his reaction in Catalina's dressing
room when I said who I was. How was he tied up in all this?  
Whatever it was would have to wait until the morning as the booze and fatigue
took their toll. I crawled into bed and was dozing into a deep sleep when a
sudden thought hit me like a lightning bolt. I sat upright with a jolt, all
thoughts of sleep vanished in an instant.  
Something Bob Arrowmint said at the wedding, "I didn't know the guy," about
Gomez. I checked the phone again to prove I hadn't imagined it. Sure enough
there was half a dozen calls to Bob Arrowmint named in the directory. Why
would he call someone he didn't know?  
I scrolled through the names to Catalina and called the number. She answered
this time.  
"Was Gomez involved with Arrowmint?" I cut to the chase.  
"Who is this?" She sounded sleepy.  
"It's Max Speed, we met at Smokey's tonight."  
"Max!" She sounded surprised. I seemed to have that kind of influence on
people lately. Maybe they were shocked that I was still alive. I looked at the
alarm clock, it was 03:06 am.  
"What time does Smokey's close?" I asked.  
"It never really closes. Max, what are you doing?"  
"Meet me there in an hour," I said and hung up. I figured there was more to
Smokey's Club than met the eye. I was going to do a bit of snooping around.  
  
A few drunks and late night revelers milled around outside Smokey's Club. The
drums of a salsa beat rumbled out somewhere in the distance. A cool night
breeze made me shiver like someone walked over my grave. I sneaked down the
side alley that ran around the back of the club. A big rat squeaked as it ran
amongst the trash cans and countless empty glass bottles.  
I shoved some crates aside and tried the door behind. It was unlocked so I
entered into the dark entrance hall. Old blues music played somewhere in the
building. Normally I loved blues but the muffled tone gave it a creepy edge.
The emergency lights from the fire exits gave just enough light to see where I
was going.  
On impulse, I followed some creaky wooden steps that led down to the cellar.
Some wooden packing crates with Spanish writing on the side lay amongst the
barrels and stacks of bottles. They looked kind of out of place so I prized
open the side of one of the crates and saw some traces of golden brown powder.
I knew what this was, definitely heroin, pure and uncut. This was the deal
behind Smokey's Club, the place was a drug den.  
The lights suddenly flicked on and a harsh voice cried out.  
"Stand still, don't move."  
I obeyed the order and slowly turned around. The big goon, who was outside
Catalina's dressing room earlier, stood in the cellar doorway pointing a huge
handgun at me. He marched me out of the cellar and up some stairs into a small
office. Smokey Cole entered the room soon after with a pissed off look on his
face.  
"You should have stayed away, Speed," he snarled. "Now you know too much."  
He picked up a phone on the desk, dialed a number and waited for a reply.  
"Yes, it's Speed. He showed up here and Jorge found him snooping around in the
cellar. Ahuh, he knows. Okay we'll wait till you get here." Smokey spoke in
hushed tones.  
We sat waiting for whoever it was on the other end of the phone. I smoked to
kill time and because Jorge, the gorilla, didn't like it. Twenty minutes later
Bob Arrowmint burst through the door. The fixed fake smile was gone.  
"Why the hell didn't you just go back to New York, Speed?"  
"I'm enjoying the warm weather but not the present company," I quipped.  
Arrowmint grinned then shook his head. "I presume you still have Gomez's
cell?"  
I nodded and placed the phone on the desk. There was no point keeping hold of
it now.  
"That was the only thing that linked me with Gomez and you had to find it. I
specifically told Lester to retrieve the cell phone," he sighed.  
"Who's Lester?" That was a name I hadn't heard.  
"Okay, I might as well tell you. Lester Roach, he's an assassin for hire and
God knows he costs enough. He's supposed to be real good but he fucked up by
leaving the cell phone in the God damn room. Then there was that other idiot
Fernandez, he was useless too. He was one of Smokey's guys." He glared at Cole
for a second.  
"Why did you want Gomez dead?" I figured I'd keep him talking now he was
spilling the beans.  
Smokey Cole glanced at his watch. He was obviously bored. I didn't know what
fate they had planned for me so I was trying to stall for time.  
"Did Gomez mention that damn boat of his?"  
I nodded. "They watched a film of it the night before they were killed."  
"I bought that boat for him. Gomez could have had anything he wanted. We were
making good money importing stuff from Cuba with that boat," Arrowmint liked
the sound of his own voice. He glanced in the mirror when he talked. I glanced
out of the window at something then quickly looked back towards Arrowmint.  
"You mean drugs," I pointed out. "Smack to be exact. The kind of stuff that
teenagers stick in their veins and o.d. on."  
"Not just heroin," Arrowmint seemed unrepentant. "It was firearms, large sums
of money, people."  
"You're quite the patriot aren't you, Arrowmint," I spat.  
Bob Arrowmint laughed insolently. "Business is business. I gave up trying to
be the Good Samaritan a long time ago. Gomez got greedy, simple as that. He
started doing deals with the Cubans behind my back. I couldn't allow that."  
"What about Carlton and Freddy? Were they in on it?" I asked.  
"They were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Lester probably didn't
know who they were."  
"That's what people like you do, Arrowmint. If someone does something they
don't like they just wipe them out and whoever else might be caught up in the
way." I was trying to piss Arrowmint off.  
"Your morality is very touching, Speed but it's late and I'm tired. Jorge and
Smokey have arranged a little fishing trip for you to go on." Arrowmint
spelled out my future or lack of it. I knew I'd be shark bait. "Take him away
to the boat."  
"Let's get this over with," Smokey hissed.  
We went back down the stairs and out of the back door. Jorge kept his gun
trained on me the whole time. Arrowmint's black Nissan 4x4 was parked next to
a blue ford.  
"It's a damn shame it came to this," Arrowmint sighed. "In other circumstances
I'm sure we would have been pals."  
"I doubt it," I snarled. "Do you play cards?"  
Arrowmint shook his head.  
"Well now you're going to know what it feels like to lose in high stakes," I
said with a smile.  
The bright light of the police search lights shone in our faces.  
"Nobody move," I recognized Amos's voice over the loudspeaker. Some uniformed
cops ran over and arrested Arrowmint, Cole and Jorge. They were led away to an
armored vehicle.  
"You took your time," I called to Amos.  
"Don't push your luck," he growled and turned away. Cops scurried around
everywhere. They went inside the club and began collecting evidence.  
Catalina emerged from the throng and walked towards me.  
"Thanks for calling Amos," I said.  
"I saw them leading you away at gunpoint. I didn't want you winding up like
Antonio," she sighed. "I knew they were smuggling in stuff and selling it from
here."  
"It was lucky they didn't see you," I said. "I noticed Amos and the cops turn
up when I was listening to Arrowmint's bullshit. I saw them from out the
window."  
"Will they go to prison?" Catalina asked.  
"Arrowmint will hire an expensive lawyer and he'll probably blame Cole and
Jorge for everything. Maybe he'll get away with it," I sighed.  
"I'll have to get a new job," she moaned.  
"With a voice like yours that shouldn't be too much trouble."  
"God damn it!" she spat. "I need a drink."  
"Good idea," I said. "I know a place where there's some chilled champagne."  
"I told you I don't like champagne," she smiled.  
I reached into one of the crates in the nightclub yard and pulled out a
bottle. I squinted in the semi light and read the label.  
"What about Caribbean rum?"  
"That'll do," she laughed.
