Prologue  
Joey "The Ace" Arnes  
  
"Alright man, I don't know what's your prob, but you gotta let me go. I din'
do nothin'." Joey spoke to his aggressor, in his undereducated use of
language. "Who's it that you want? I can give 'em to ya. Just gimme a name and
I'll have my boys pop some caps." Arnes forced a smile.  
"I've gotten who I want." The captor spoke in a deep, grisly, almost unnatural
voice. He was dressed in an all-black cloak, complete with hood. The hood,
accompanying the dark room, made it impossible to point out a face. The hooded
figure pulled something out of his cloak.  
"Woah, if I did somethin', just tell me man. I've got some high-quality
Columbia shit that I can hand over to you. I won't tell my boys or anything,
man. Just don't go all crazy on me." Arnes was now pleading, bargaining for
his life. Sweat began to run down his nervous face.  
"Lets see..." the hooded figure spoke confidently "I believe the police report
stated you fired no less than four bullets into her head?" The cloaked
assassin walked around behind Arnes and held the item up to his head. "I'm
just here to make sure you get what you deserve."  
"Hey man! Don't be this way. It's a job. If I took out someone you cared
about, I'm sorry. You know how it is." Arnes fumbled in the chair he was tied
into, intensely frightened.  
"You're right. I do know how it is." Arnes heard the cock of a gun behind his
head. "I know how it is to watch as everything you've ever done collapses at
the hands of the selfish. I'm here to finish the job I should have done
before."  
"WAIT! IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE TH-"  
Arnes didn't get to finish his sentence. It may have been because he was too
scared, or perhaps because of the .38 caliber Smith & Wesson revolver bullet
fired into the back of his skull.  
"We're not done just yet." The assailant spoke, and continued to fire more
rounds into the body. "I think that's a little more than four." He laughed.
Afterwards, the he took a specialized pen from his cloak and held it in his
gloved hands. The pen acted as a siphon to take the blood out of the dead
body, apparently using it as ink. He then began to write on the lifeless
corpse...  
  
  
  
  
Chapter One  
Detective Dustin Hughes  
  
Detective Hughes walked onto the murder scene in an apartment home. The
investigative team had already been there and had taken their evidence. At the
crime scene, he met up with his partner at the entrance of the apartment
building.  
"Good morning, good sir." His long-time partner, Detective Madeline Voir had
greeted him. Madeline was a beautiful woman, with dark black hair and deep,
blue eyes. She walked in a firm, demanding manner, and she spoke in just the
same way, along with a beautifully sophisticated secretary-like voice.  
"Eh, I wouldn't call being pulled onto a scene a good morning." Hughes was
obviously tired as he lifted up the "POLICE LINE - DO NOT CROSS" tape for his
partner. "After you, ma'am."  
Voir gave a witty smile before sliding under the tape. They then both walked
into the room where the crime had occurred.  
"Oh God!" Voir let out as she had seen what lie before her. Hughes was not
impressed with the show of blood, he had been working in this business for far
longer than his partner.  
"Relax, it's a murder scene, you've seen them before." Hughes said as he
walked up to examine the corpse. At first glance he could see that six shots
had been fired into the corpse, all in the head, and judging by the angle and
size, at point-blank range.  
"Yeah, but never one this gruesome!" Voir replied, shocked. She then advanced
with Hughes, being careful not to step in the pool of blood flooding the
floor.  
"Yup, we've got ourselves quite a murderer here. He's a clever one, I assure
you." Informed Officer Jult, who had been on the scene. "Apparently the guy's
got a certain number of kills." He then walked over to the victim. He was a
dark skinned male, but far too difficult to distinguish a face, being as it
had taken several bullets. "Our killer left us a little note, he calls himself
'Karma'." The officer then handed Hughes a blood stained piece of paper.  
  
What goes around, comes around.  
-Karma  
  
Hughes flipped the card over, examining it further, but found nothing. "Hm.
Quite clever."  
"Um, you said he had a certain number of victims?" spoke Madeline, who was
standing patiently, looking at the corpse.  
"Ah, yes. I did say that." The officer spoke in enlightenment. "Here, see what
the murderer wrote on the victim." He pointed to the victims lower leg, which
read:  
  
1/24  
  
"It gets more interesting, the little fraction trick that our buddy found
funny..." The officer stopped and looked at Hughes, "... was written with the
victim's own blood."  
  
  
  
  
  
Chapter Two  
Detective Dustin Hughes  
  
Hughes entered the conference room and took his place at the end of the table.
Mostly familiar faces joined him. His partner sat across from him. As usual,
little murmurs broke out between the people there.  
"Did you hear? The murderer wrote on the body."  
"With a pen or something?"  
"No man! Blood. And it turns out it was the victim's blood."  
"That's just sick."  
Hughes smirked over at Madeline and whispered, "Hehe, amateurs. They'll learn
to see much more of this in the future, if they can take it."  
Before she could answer, a hush came over the room. The chief entered the
room, with a small manila colored folder in hand. He tossed it on the table.
"That file contains all we know about the victim."  
The chief circled the table. The other detectives dove into the folder,
picking out different papers. "Chief... it says here that there was some kind
of fraction on the victim?"  
The chief nodded and sighed. "The murderer seems to plan on killing at least
24 people according to this... 'fraction'."  
Another detective piped up, "And there was no physical evidence of our
killer?"  
The chief repeated his last action, nodding and sighing. "Nope. This person
knows what they're doing."  
Hughes took a look at the file. The victim was a troublemaker. Thefts, GTA,
hell - even murder. Joseph Arnes. Went by Joey or "The Ace". Joey left a mob
he was in and cleared his criminal record a few years back. Wonder how he
survived. Everyone else in that mob was killed. "Looks like our victim left
some business unfinished."  
The chief turned to Hughes. "That's the only thing we can go on right now. The
only mob Arnes belonged to had every member assassinated. I still don't see
why he was still alive."  
Hughes nodded, flipping through the file. Didn't seem to interest him that
much. Seemed too basic for him. He tossed it back to the middle of the table.
The chief went to the front of the room. "Now, we need someone to take on this
case."  
Hughes decided to try and take a nap. Then, "Me and Hughes will take it."  
Hughes turned to see Madeline with her hand raised. Hughes frowned, knowing he
wouldn't be able to stop her. "Well, shit..."  
  
  
  
  
  
Chapter Three  
Detective Madeline Voir  
  
"Are you kidding me,Voir?" Hughes complained to his partner, "You've been here
for over five years. I don't find interest in these cases."  
"I'm sorry Dustin, I just thought this would be an interesting case..."
Madeline replied nervously.  
"Yeah, real fun. Now you've got me looking through files of some Hannibal
Lector-esque criminal! He's nothing. He just wants to make a point of himself.
He wants to seem famous. He wants to go down as notorious, diabolical, evil.
We're here to make sure that doesn't happen. Someone else is going to die, and
it's going to be our asses if we don't get this guy!" Hughes spoke, almost
yelling. Madeline could tell she caused a problem, but she didn't regret
taking the case.  
"It's okay. I'm sure we'll be able to get him." Madeline spoke, unsure of
herself.  
"And if we don't, guess who gets fired, and blamed for all the murders?"
Hughes looked at Voir, yet she remained silent. "The irresponsible detectives
Madeline Voir, and Dustin Hughes! I don't need to take this case, Madeline!"  
Madeline looked down at the floor, disappointed with herself.  
"Well, I need this case..." She said through clenched teeth.  
  
  
  
  
  
Chapter Four  
Detective Dustin Hughes  
  
"Arnes was a bit more ruthless than we thought." Hughes told Voir as he
watched her look through Arnes' record. "You're amazing at looking up file
data. Probably because you're in our database all the time." Hughes laughed as
he looked at the extensive amount of information that Madeline pulled out of
the database.  
"Yup, our guy's got quite a record. He was involved in the Queen incident.
Somehow he survived." Voir spoke while reading off the monitor. "That explains
a bit, but not everything."  
Hughes was surprised, "What do you mean? You just closed our case, Voir! We've
got everything we need now. He was involved in the Queen incident. That's all
the information we need!"  
Hughes recalled the incident in the back of his head. About eight years ago,
the mob known as la Famille de la Reine, (Literally meaning 'The family of the
queen") was the lead in cocaine sales. Their product was around 100% pure
cocaine, which makes insane amounts of money. Eventually, the previous lead in
coke sales got fed up with their money being lost, they decided it was time to
take out the Queen's family. All of the members of the family were
assassinated, but perhaps Arnes survived. Which solves their problem. He must
have been killed because the opposing mob needed to finish up their business.  
Hughes stopped mid-thought. "Well, how do we explain the fraction?"  
"Hm. 1/24..." Voir thought aloud, " we read it backwards. That simple. 1/24
simply means he was the final one to be killed. Case closed. Now the queens
family is all dead. There's no one left to get rid of." Voir laughed. "Case
closed." She said as she walked out of the room.  
Hughes walked over to the computer and something caught his eye. "Maybe not."
He said, and furthered his research.  
  
  
  
Chapter Five  
Miss Jenny Voltaire and Mr. Jacob DeVeaux  
  
A dimly lit Italian restaurant, out of the way of the big city, played host to
two old friends. In the middle of the restaurant, around a small table, sat
two accomplices. Man and woman. The man was in his mid-thirties but looked
more like he was in his mid-sixties. Thick black hair was his greatest
feature, and even that was starting to go as there were patches of gray
throughout it. He wore a nice Armani suit and wore thin shades.  
The woman was a bit younger, though she looked around the same age. She had
sleek brown hair that ran down to her back. Her hazel eyes could hypnotize any
man. She spoke first. "Did ya hear? The last of Queens rats got taken out the
other day."  
The man, who was chewing his food, took a while to answer. "Well ain't that
something. So, your sayin' he wasn't one of ours?"  
The woman nodded. "Tha's zactly what I'm sayin' Jakey. I thought we got rid of
all thems."  
Jake looked ready to answer, but stopped once he heard a ring. Jen's
cellphone. The woman looked down and grabbed her phone. "Mm. I hafta go to the
restroom for a minute hon." She winked. "Don't you worry about me."  
Jenny sauntered her way through the mostly empty restaurant, to the restroom.
Once she got there, she gave her self a look in the mirror, sent herself a
smooch and grabbed her phone. "Darlin' I have business to do ya know? I dun
have any time for this."  
She answered her phone with a light "Hello?" and turned to lean against the
porcelain sink in the dimly lit restroom. She noticed that there was no one
behind her. Hm... I coulda sworn Jakey was behind me.  
"Jenny, you hear about the rats?" The voice on the other end of the phone
spoke.  
"Yeah, I heard. Who's this anyway?" Jenny spoke uncertainly.  
"It's Pierce." The voice spoke.  
"Hey Eddie, how's it goin'? Yeah, I heard about the rats. Seems they all been
flushed out, eh? Nice job. I'll be sure to give you and your boys a kiss."  
"That's the thing, Jen." The bathroom chandelier's lights all began to
flicker. Jen looked at the chandelier menacingly, as if the flicker would stop
if her eyes focused on just the right part. The chandelier, however, stared
back with more angst than she could handle. "It wasn't our boys."  
Jen gasped. Her face was awestruck... right before it was struck again. With a
three foot by six inches solid tin baseball bat. The violent noise that her
skull made was ear-shattering, but only if you were within hearing distance.
And, unluckily for her, no-one was. The tin bat was now streaked with blood,
so violently stained that it reached the owner. Jen could concentrate on
nothing but the intense pain in having her very skull cave in to the point
where it is piercing into her own brain, or at least the parts of her brain
that are still in her head. Everything went black within the lighting fast
moment.  
  
"Excuse me, sir?" a man called to Mr. DeVeaux.  
"What is it you want, buddy?" Jacob responded in an angry tone.  
"Given her sincerest apologies, Miss Jennifer has left and a requested
chauffeur is awaiting outside for your departure." The young, dark-haired man
with a name tag that read 'Trent' spoke with a tremble and a sweat. He was
scared. Obviously very scared. Jacob smiled at the thought that he intimidated
him so deeply. "Sir, if you'll please follow me to the awaiting vehicle."  
Jacob sighed, "Damn you Jenny." He looked up after shaking his head at the
boy, "Very well. Let's go." Jake stood up to follow the boy.  
"This way, sir." The boy lead Jacob to the end of the crimson-red draped
restaurant and out the main door, in front was a limousine awaiting him. "Here
you are, sir." The boy closed his eyes tight. "Good evening."  
Weird kid, doesn't even require a tip. Jacob awaited his chauffeur to open his
door, and he did so politely. Ha, Drivey boy isn't wearing a hat. That's a
first. Never knew he was blonde. Jacob then entered the vehicle, the door
closed behind him. "So, we going home, Robert?"  
"No Mr. DeVeaux, We're driving to the nearest lake." The chauffeur turned into
view of the passenger. His face was pale, and he had thin blonde hair. The man
seemed fairly old, yet their was some sort of deviance in him, some sort of
rebellion, some sense of revenge.  
"You're not Robert. Wonder what happened to him. Well anyway, I don't wish to
go to the lake. I wish to go home. Surely even through your idiocy you can do
that, correct?"  
"Oh, sorry Mr. DeVeaux, but we must go to the lake. After all..." The man
pulled out a handgun. "I need somewhere to hide the body." A solitary shot was
fired. Not by the driver though, the passenger. Jacob was fast-handed enough
to pull his 9mm from his belt and fire it. Sadly, he wasn't fast-eyed enough
to aim correctly. A second shot was fired, this time from the driver. Jacob
then looked down at the blood that was now pouring from his shirt. Yet another
shot was fired, but Jacob only felt the bullet. He was dead before he could
hear the blast from the revolver. The bullet went straight into his head.  
  
  
  
  
  
Chapter Six  
Trent Dayton  
  
Trent was only 20, with black hair that he slicked back. He was a waiter at Il
Cancello, a high-class Italian restaurant. He would never have gotten this
job, much less any other, were it not for the fact that his dad was shift
manager at the place. Today was quite a day for Trent. He had just finished
serving a table when he was sent over to latrine duty. As he walked out of the
mens restroom a woman stopped him.  
"Sir, the chandelier in the womans restroom is flickering, could you have a
look at it please?"  
"Yes, ma'am. I'll get right on it." Trent spoke. Trent returned his supplies
to the closet and headed over to the womens restroom. He placed the "Do Not
Enter" sign above the door so no woman would decide that'd it be a good time
to join him in the restroom. As standard procedure, he knocked three times to
assure no one was inside. Thud, Thud, Thud. Nope. No-one. Trent then entered
the bathroom only to see the corpse of a woman on the floor with pools of
blood flowing from every crevice in her head. He ran over to the body with a
sick feeling in his stomach. He stood up to run and tell the manager, but
something in a flicker of the chandelier caught his eye. A figure in the dark.
"Who's there?" He spoke, with no reply. Then the figure stepped out of the
shadows, and in front of the exit. Holy-. Now I'm Screwed.  
"Nighty-night." The figure said as he stepped forward, a bloody baseball bat
in his hand. He was dressed in a dark robe, hood and all. The man then ran
toward Trent as the panicked waiter jumped back to escape. His plans of escape
were foiled as he slipped on the blood of the woman and fell to the floor.
"Please! Don't hurt me!" Trent pleaded with the man standing over him.  
"Oh, don't worry, I won't." The light flickered on just long enough to see the
man smile and have Trent witness his decayed teeth flash. "Follow me or die."  
Outside the restaurant, in an alley just bordering Il Cancello, the man spoke
to Trent. "Here's what you're going to do Trent." He spoke as the two of them
walked over to a nearby limousine."You have a Mister DeVeaux in your
restaurant tonight. You're going to tell him that a Miss Jennifer Voltaire was
called away." The man then knocked on the window of the limousine with the
butt of his handgun and motioned for the driver to exit the car.  
"Please, I don't want any trouble!" The driver said as he left the car. He was
an old man, with a grey mustache and an interesting looking hat. And by
interesting, I mean funny-looking. The man was then motioned to kneel by the
wall of the restaurant. He did so.  
"Then, Buddy-boy, you're going to tell Mister DeVeaux that there's a limo
waiting out front to take him home. Then you'll lead him to it. And I'll..."
The man pointed his pistol at the back of the knelt drivers head. "Finish him
off." The man fired a round into the drivers head, causing blood to spurt on
the wall, and his hat to fall on the floor.  
"No!" Trent yelled. The man then pulled the gun on Trent, silencing him. Trent
was sweating violently. He was scared, frightened, and nearly dead.  
"What're you waiting for? Go on." The man spoke to Trent. "I think I'll take
it all, except for the shitty hat." Trent began to walk away. "Oh Trent.
Remember this; if you fuck up, you know what I'm capable of."  
  
Inside the restaurant, Trent approached his target. Seated alone at a table
for two, and enjoying his lobster dinner, sat Mister Jacob DeVeaux.  
"Excuse me, sir?" Spoke Trent. Sweating and trembling in fear of the psychotic
man.  
"What is it you want, buddy?" Jacob spoke to him.  
"Given her sincerest apologies, Miss Jennifer has left and a requested
chauffeur is awaiting outside for your departure." He noticed Jacob smile as
he spoke."Sir, if you'll please follow me to the awaiting vehicle."  
The seated man sighed with a "Damn you Jenny.", then spoke up. "Very well.
Let's go."  
"This way, sir." Trent said as he walked Jacob to his awaiting limousine.  
  
  
  
  
Chapter Seven  
Detective Dustin Hughes  
  
Saturday evenings in Hughes' household were often the same. Lights were dim,
the world was quiet and Dustin would finally relax. Actually, this was Hughes'
dream. For you see, the Hughes household was actually a small cramped
apartment, which sat near the subway. His lights were in fact dim, but this
was only cause the electricity was faulty. And his world was anything but
quiet at all times. Either it was the couple upstairs arguing or the family
next door having a party. God forbid both. And when Hughes got home on this
Saturday, something had surprised him. It was neither.  
"Odd... no lamps breaking... no kids yelling..." He tossed his jacket onto his
scraggly old recliner and stretched. "It looks like the man upstairs is giving
me a break." Hughes meant this literally and spiritually.  
He chuckled at his little joke and decided to try to relax himself. The hard-
worked detective stumbled over his packed living room and fell onto the couch.
With a slow "Ahh..." he grabbed a remote, pushed a power button on it, and his
small living room came to life with ambient sounds coming at him from multiple
speakers. It was a generic ocean sounds CD he found in the break room at work.
It was nice to hear it fully, with no curses being thrown in between each bird
squawk. And just as he was about to nod off, finally feeling well with himself
and his living situation. It all fell in.  
The subway rumbled past his apartment, a large crash sound came from above him
(he guessed that the bookcase was thrown again), and loud music came blasting
from his side. He immediately hopped up and groaned. "Jesus. Give me a
break..."  
The one thing that did happen at that time that actually held his interest was
a phone ring. Hopping over a small barricade in the form of his small black
and white television, he reached the phone. "Hughes here...", he covered the
receiver of the phone as he spoke,"Hm? Another one, eh? And I have to be in
now?" A sigh. "Fine. I'll be over soon. Okay Voir. See you there."  
With another large sigh, he set the phone down. "Off to the worst decision of
my life..." He grabbed his jacket and headed out. Another day on the grind.  
  
  
  
  
  
Chapter Eight  
Forensics Officer Jult Toren  
  
"Well, he was medium height, blonde, but cloaked. Uh, he had a hood to match
the cloak and he held a gun." This was the claim that a Mr. Trent Dayton made
for the killer that took two lives at the crime scene last night.  
"Sounds like our boy Karma. Well, at least we got a decent description of him.
Mr. Dayton, could you please show us how you interacted with this man? He's a
vicious murderer and without your help, he could strike again." Jult looked
into the boy's eyes with utter seriousness.  
"Yeah, sure." The kid responded, shaking and sweating. The officer thought it
was slightly humorous how much the law enforcement intimidated him. The
officer followed the boy into the woman's restroom.  
"Here's where I found her." Trent grimaced at the sight and smell of the
corpse, left untouched on the floor.  
"I see..." Jult remarked, being sure to take careful notes of the
surroundings. The light, a solitary chandelier, flickered in the room. Some
sort of skid mark in the pool of blood near the womans head. Footprints
trailing out of the restroom, coated with blood. But the most noticeable of
all was on the mirror. Written in blood.  
  
2/24  
-Kar  
  
"Odd. It seems that karma only wrote a portion of his signature." Jult thought
aloud.  
"Or perhaps," Trent blurted out, "He was interrupted. I may have entered when
he was in the midst of writing."  
"Hm. Good point. Well, care to show me where he led you afterwards?" Jult said
to Trent with a spark in his eye. Jult followed Trent Into the alleyway beside
the restaurant.  
"Here's where he told me to bring the other guy out. And where he shot the
driver." Dayton pointed at the lifeless remains of the driver slumped against
the restaurant wall. Blood staining his near-naked body.  
"I'm assuming he stripped him of his clothes. Took everything in an attempt to
assume the role as a driver." Jult smirked as he looked down at the corpse.
"But apparently he didn't want the hat, seeing as he left it on him." Jult
looked down at the hat that was left on the lap of the fallen chauffeur. The
blood fallen from the bullet hole in the drivers head had seeped onto the hat,
marking it permanently. "Thanks, kid. You're free to go now."  
"So, we got a psycho that'll kill anyone in the way. A missing man with the
psycho, possibly dead. And we've got another case of bad Karma. This is gonna
be a great one to explain to Hughes and Voir.
