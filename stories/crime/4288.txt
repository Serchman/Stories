**** Intro:** a story about a psychologist recounting his first psychological interview with a serial killer and how it effected his life. 

* * *

The first time I heard the name Robert Green was almost 20 years ago now, when
he first got arrested for the murder of over 15 women. I never thought, almost
5 years later, after graduating from Harvard with honours in criminal
psychology that I would actually be interviewing the man himself. If I had
known then how drastically my life was going to change after that interview I
would have taken more time to really think about whether I was ready. But what
can I do now? My life is what it is. Nothing I can do can change what it has
become.  
July 22nd 1995 was an unsurprisingly sunny, hot day in Palm Coast, Florida. As
I was driving to the state prison, a short one hour fifty five minute journey
on the interstate 95 North, "Waterfalls" by TLC the number one for the week
came on the radio. "But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much..." the song
trailed off with my thoughts of the interview to come "...cause he can't seem
to keep his self out of trouble..." I don't think the realisation had actually
set in about what was going to happen "...another body laying cold in the
gutter..." I mean I was going to meet a real serial killer, this wasn't some
video I was watching or textbook I was reading; I was going to meet someone
who had killed another human being and not just one.  
I think the first time I really started to get nervous was about five minutes
before he was due to be sitting in front of me. Suddenly all the moisture
seemed to evaporate from my mouth and be transported to my already sweaty
hands. Then he was brought into the room. All my initial thoughts were blocked
from my mind, as the shock and realisation of the situation took over me.
Green obviously noticed this as a small chuckle escaped his lips.  
"Mr Green, pleased to meet you," I managed to dryly cough out.  
"Please call me Robert, Dr. Isaacs" It seemed more like a business meeting
than an interview with a serial killer, "and it's a pleasure to meet you too."  
The guards left the room with an assuring nod from me.  
"Right, then. I guess we will get started"  
The term ‘normal' is despised in the psychology world as no one really knows
what it means or who can fit into this category however Robert Green was
sitting there and just talked and acted like a normal person, like he wasn't
this murderous, evil man who preyed on women.  
It started in March of '82 when a young woman was found dead on the beach of
Miami. It was later discovered that she was 18 year old Kate DeSol. She had
long brown hair and she was from a middle class, catholic background. Kate's
injuries were so severe that she had to be identified through her dental
records because she had so many facial wounds where she had been brutally
beaten to death with a crowbar but not before she had been viciously raped
multiple times. By the summer of '88, when I had just started Harvard, a 26
year old Green had already raped and beaten to death 15 women according to the
state of Florida however he admitted to many more since his initial arrest.
During this time, like most organised and non-social offenders, Green could
not hold down a job for very long because of his above average intelligence
and had joined and dropped out of numerous universities around the Florida
state.  
"Well, Robert, you are scheduled to be executed tomorrow morning at 9.00am.
What thoughts are running through your mind?" I asked while I tried to retain
eye contact with him.  
"Well, I would be lying if I said I had come to terms with what is going to
happen. At this moment I feel relatively calm mainly because you are here and
I don't have to think about my imminent death." I couldn't help but feel sorry
for the man: death is something no one wants but he had a choice to carry out
what he did and he did realistically deserve the punishment.  
"Just for the record, you are admitting your guilt?"  
He couldn't keep eye contact at this point. "Yes, I am guilty"  
"Well, my next question is what drove you to do it? What in your life pushed
you to commit the heinous crimes you did?" I knew I had probed a little too
far at this point because his face turned stern  
"You don't know how many times I have asked myself that question. Honestly, I
don't think it was just one event. Maybe I was born this way, maybe I had the
extra ‘Y' chromosome, or maybe it was other factors in my life,"  
Robert Green was a perfect case of a power/control killer where they kill to
gain and exert power over their victims. In this case, like so many others,
Green wanted to exert his power over women, mainly young, white, middle class
women with a Catholic background and long, straight brown hair. Most
psychologists, including myself, believe he attacked these women because of
events in his adolescence. He was 15 years old when he had been told that he
was adopted. His adopted mother gave him a letter that his birth mother had
written when she had given him up. What had actually been written is unclear,
however, we did know that she had enclosed a photograph of herself so it is
believed that the women he attacked looked like her. As he attacked middle
class women with a catholic background, many leading psychologists believe she
had given Green up because he was a bastard child and her family didn't want
the shame of it associated with the family name.  
Half way through the interview the lights cut out.  
"Don't worry doc, they will come back on in a minute,"  
"How do you know?" All of sudden they flickered back to how they were moments
before.  
"They were just testing old sparky out for it's big performance tomorrow," he
laughed trying not to show the fear of his approaching death.  
"Do you think this punishment is just for the crimes you have committed?" his
eyes quickly darted up to meet mine for a brief second then he took a long
breath.  
"I guess I do, I mean one less monster in the world isn't a bad thing." He
genuinely looked remorseful.  
"Would you not rather have a life? I mean a long life and die when God wants
you to?"  
A wry smile graced his face momentarily, "What would be the point? I would
simply be prolonging the inevitable, Phlegethon, being immersed into a river
of boiling blood guarded by Centaurs"  
"Dante's seventh circle of hell?" I posed  
"Good man, are you a fan of Dante's Inferno?"  
For that split second it felt as if I was just talking to friend, a friend who
I had known for years, a friend who hadn't killed, raped and mutilated
numerous women throughout the past decade. As much I wanted to hate this man
for what he did to those women, the fact he was so similar to me in age and
background made it easier and easier for me to separate the man from the crime
and to think of him more as an equal. But I had to snap out of it. I couldn't
keep drifting into my own thoughts. I would, as I have now, of driven myself
mad sitting there in front of him.  
"Can I ask you one final question?"  
"What's up doc?" he joked imitating Bugs Bunny  
"Why did you want to do this interview today? Why now? Why me?" he let a
chuckle escape his lips just as he had done at the start of the interview.  
"I believe that's three questions?" he asked sarcastically  
"Humour me"  
"To answer your first and second question, I have absolutely nothing to lose
now, I am going to be killed tomorrow and so nothing I really say now will
come back to hurt me," He looked up to directly meet my gaze, "and you third
question, well, I guess I just believed as you are similar to me in age that
you would be most likely to believe what I say and the least likely to twist
my words."  
The traumatic aspect of the interview which has haunted me for the past 15
years is not the fact I met with a serial killer who had performed the most
heinous crimes to women, not the fact I was the last person he had ever talked
to, but it was the fact that we were so similar. We had a similar sense of
humour and intellectual level; he had been accepted into some of the most
prestigious schemes in the country, the same schemes I had when I was at high
school and university and we both were of a similar age. It could have so
easily been me. If I had been adopted I could of turned into a brutal murderer
just like him. Sitting there talking to him at times seemed like I was just
talking to a friend I had known for years.  
July 23rd 1995 was an unsurprisingly sunny, hot day for Palm Coast, Florida
except for one person who although saw the sunrise that day did not see it
set. The only words that can really surmise that bittersweet day come from
TLC's second number one. 3 letters took him to his final resting place.
