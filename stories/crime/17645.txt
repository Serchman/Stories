**** Intro:** A glimpse into the not so distant future in a dystopian Society about the trial of Eve, a woman convicted for using her emotions. 

* * *

The Judge entered through the heavy oak door on the northern wall of the court
room. His long black robes rolled effortlessly with each step he took, an odd
contrast to his stone-like demeanor and unrelenting glare. He approached his
bench and turned to meet the eyes of those standing in the room, waiting
respectfully and patiently for the Judge to have a seat, so they may follow.
His visage grew even more stern as he noticed someone sitting. He shook his
head and knew instantly who this disrespectful hooligan was. The woman sat
uneasy upon the hard wooden bench. She had first been standing, but her feet
were swollen and as each second passed the task seemed to grow more difficult.
She noticed eyes from all around staring at her, scrutinizing, judgmental
eyes. After a motioning back and forth a few times, the woman was able to
propel herself upwards into an awkward stance. The Judge nodded, sat down and
finally motioned the rest in attendance to follow suit.  
  
“Order in the Court!” the Judge said tapping his mahogany gavel twice.  
“The charges of Unauthorized Heterosexual Intercourse, Unauthorized Conception
and Unauthorized Zone Interaction are brought against miss...uh what do they
call you?”  
“Eve, your honor”  
“Ah yes, that. Well, how do you plead?”  
“Not guilty your honor”  
“Well that settles it then, nex—wait, did you say not guilty?”  
“That is correct your honor”  
“Well then. You chose to represent yourself in the case. By all means miss,
enlighten the Court of Justice on their misunderstanding of the law.”  
  
After a little effort, Eve stood up and nervously turned to address the jury.
“Jury of Peers”, she chuckled at the irony of the label as she stared at
thirteen men dressed in pressed black three-piece suits, their eyes cold and
full of a genuine hatred.  
  
“Good sirs, I beg of you to look past the fact that I am but a mere woman and
see my situation for the crime that it truly is, not the one I am accused of,
but the real crime that started it all. You see, 6 months ago to the day, I
was taken against my will and forced to undergo heterosexual intercourse. This
is the true crime and as a result, I am now with child and have been accused
of crimes that I was not responsible for. How can myself, a lowly female, ever
hope to get away with such heinous acts? Why would one commit such crimes,
when they know that such acts are forbidden and punishable by death? Is not
self-preservation written in the Doctrine? This is the document that we as
citizens, even those of us at lower stations, uphold above all. Please, take
my words into consideration while making a decision on my fate.”  
  
With those words, Eve turned and took her place back on the uncomfortable
bench. She couldn't tell if the odd churning in her gut was that of the child
she carried or simply her nerves.  
  
“Thank you for that...interesting tale, girl,” said the Judge, “Let us see
what the prosecutor has to say to that.”  
  
With a nod, the prosecutor stood facing the jury. With his pressed black
three-piece and slicked hair, one could have easily mistaken the prosecutor
for one of the members of the jury. The only distinguishing difference was the
cocky grin on his face, one that simultaneously comforted and disturbed
onlookers.  
  
“Thank you your Honor. Gentlemen of the jury, I come here today not to try and
persuade you to make the right decision, but to simply remind you of the laws,
all of which I am quite certain you already know. Ever since the Great
Recession, it has been decided that women are no longer fit to make decisions
for the good of the Society, of family or even of themselves. Their natural
need to show emotion and their inability to suppress this flaw was declared
primitive and no longer necessary. Even when faced with the devastatingly high
global population, women were the ones who disobeyed the Doctrine and
continued to participate in rogue acts of heterosexual intercourse, only
fueling the fire and adding to the problem. We, as intelligent men, understand
that this flaw is a natural thing and that we cannot change it, so mercifully
we spared the women after their rebellion and ask only that they obey and not
interfere with progress that the Society has made without them. Yet, there are
those that still wish to destroy all that we have worked for. Currently, we
have successfully controlled the global population with our Doctrine, which
clearly states the no man and no woman shall participate in intercourse
without the proper approval of the Republic. Already, this woman's
irresponsible actions have lead to disastrous consequences. Look at the her! A
child, one without registration, one without a family, one without a future
grows inside of her as we speak! I trust gentlemen that you will see through
this woman's web of deceit into her true intentions, ones of destruction, that
can come from no other source than a woman's unrelenting emotions.”  
  
Satisfied with the reaction of the jury, the prosecutor took his seat,
confident as ever that he would win this case and be home in time for supper.
He knew his husband would have dinner waiting for him when he got there. This
was the legal arrangement that all married men agreed to before the Republic
considered their marriage. Each would illustrate their expectations of the
other, each fair and each duty delegated appropriately. No complicated
variability or destructive emotion. Simple, the way life should be, thought
the prosecutor.  
  
“Well that about settles it. Gentlemen of the jury, you may make your
decision,” said the Judge  
“Wait!” Eve yelled, desperate, she racked her brain for an excuse for such an
outburst. Especially by a woman!  
“Yes girl, what is it?”  
This is it, Eve thought. She had hopped it wouldn’t have to come down to this
and she would be able to get off without placing blame to anyone except
herself. Her brain kept telling her to keep quiet and take the punishment,
however severe. But something inside of her screamed in protest and no matter
futility of the attempt Eve stood to defend herself.  
“I would like to call to the stand the father of the child that I bear!”  
The stoic glare of the men in the courtroom transformed into one of confusion.
What did this woman think she was doing? Even the Judge, the embodiment of the
Society, structured and cold, was taken aback by such an outburst, even by the
emotionally-cursed woman.  
“Well that would be interesting, but unfortunately for you, the said man isn't
present and thus I cannot grant your request.”  
“Your Honor, the man is standing to your right.”  
All eyes in the room snapped to the bailiff. The man had slicked back hair and
looked almost identical to the rest of the men in the room, save his uniform.
It was navy blue or black, depending on the lighting above him, complete with
a shiny, triangle-shaped badge that read “Justice, Republic, Society”. Wide-
eyed, the man turned to the Judge.  
“Uh, what should I do your Honor?”  
“Um, well I suppose you should take the stand Bailiff. You have nothing to
hide I'm sure.”  
  
With a shrug, the man approached the stand. He held a large leather-bound book
in his left hand. “Doctrine of the Republic” was stitched in gold letter on
its spine. He placed his right hand in the air while trying to awkwardly
balance the large text in his left. He did well throughout the first verse,
but was puzzled when he had to turn the page. Confused, he swapped hands and
somehow during the struggle the book was upside down. Raising his left hand
and reading upside down, the bailiff finally completed the oath and took his
spot on the stand.  
  
“Mr. Dam, where were you on November 5th of last year?” Eve asked  
“Uh, I dunno. Prolly at work,” the man replied.  
“Oh, I was not aware the court was functioning on a Saturday. Was that a
special occasion?”  
Concerned the prosecutor flipped through his paperwork. Frowning he looked
back up toward the stand. His cocky-ness wavering slightly. Indeed, the date
was on a Saturday.  
“Uh, well I guess I was home then.”  
“Was anyone with you to confirm that, Mr. Dam? Your husband perhaps?”  
Damn it, no alibi. This case might be a bit harder than I thought.  
“No. I live alone.”  
“Are you sure you were at home? Is there something else you may have been
doing on a Saturday? Cruising around Old Town perhaps?”  
Yes! She slipped.  
“Objection! Mr. Dam is not under trial here your Honor. Zone Interaction is
her crime, not his!”the prosecutor interrupted  
“Sustained. Go on girl, rephrase the question.”  
“Okay, perhaps you were at a particular bowling alley Downtown. Ring any
bells?”  
“Oh yeah! Me and the guys went to grab a few games before the tournament the
next day.”  
“How did you fair at the tournament?”  
“Third place, woulda had second but I messed up that last hook.”  
“Thats odd. Your recollection of the tournament seems pretty detailed, but you
forgot what you did the entire day before?”  
“Uh, yeah I spose that is a bit odd.”  
“Tell me Mr. Dam, are there any specials at that bowling alley on Saturdays?”  
“Yeah, that's buy a shot get one free night. Boy, does a days work go fast on
Saturdays.” Even as he spoke, a twinkle in his normally colorless eye at the
mention of alcohol showed suddenly, unnoticeable to the unperceptive men, but
to Eve it was a clear sign that she was onto something.  
“So it would seem that you had quite a few that night. Would that be correct?”  
“You could say so. That aint a crime though, I aint no woman, I can handle my
booze.”  
“Would you disagree that alcohol makes you feel good?”  
“What do you mean?”  
“I mean, after a particularly hard day at work, you would have a drink or two
to feel better right? Blow off some steam?”  
“Yeah, sure why not?”  
“So you agree that alcohol brings out an emotional response? Something that
the Doctrine, the book by which you base your career and your life, declares a
dangerous thing that cannot be controlled. Something that men with their
superior willpower should have control over, unlike us women.”  
The prosecutor didn’t know how to respond to this. She’s using emotion against
him? That’s my tactic! Frustrated he ruffled through some more paperwork.  
“Whoah, I didn't say all that.”  
“But it’s true, do you not agree? Emotion is a weakness. The Doctrine states
that much afterall.”  
“Well yes—.”  
“So you agree then?”  
“Yeah I suppose so.”  
“So would it be possible that in your emotional state, one that is difficult
to control while intoxicated, that you wandered into Old Town in search of
some companionship?”  
“I guess, but that aint me. I didn't do nothin.”  
“And if it were possible for you to resort to such a primitive state of mind
due to alcohol, it would be possible for you to commit another primitive
action, perhaps heterosexual intercourse?”  
“What? No! Of course not! I'm a man! It was you who lured me into a trap! You
used your seduction to get yourself pregnant and start a new rebellion!”  
Mr. Dam exploded to his feet, wide-eyed his slick hair ruffled at he grabbed
it in frustration. His pale skin was now the brightest color in the cold grey-
toned room. His triangle-shaped badge fell to the floor. As he regained
control of himself he looked at all of the eye around him. That look, the same
look of disgust that Eve received. Embarrassed, he took his seat, slow and
deliberate as if someone had a gun on him.  
“So you do remember?” Eve finished  
“No further questions your Honor.”  
  
Satisfied with her work, Eve took her seat. Flabbergasted, the bailiff looked
to the Judge for help. The Judge offered only a shrug and the bailiff tried to
keep his emotions under control, ordinarily a particularly easy task, but this
was no ordinary situation. All eyes were now on the prosecutor. He was the
only one that could turn this thing around. With a tad less confidence, the
prosecutor rose from his seat and went to the bailiff.  
  
“Mr. Dam, A. Dam. What’s the 'A' there for chief?” the prosecutor asked the
terrified witness.  
“Uh...Alex. Name's Alex.”  
“Well Alex, we have just heard a very lovely tale from our defendant, isn't
that correct Alex?”  
“Huh?”  
“That it was a tale, good sir, and not an ounce of truth to it. Is that
correct?”  
“Well not really...I mean, not how I remember that night.”  
“By all means, please tell us how you remember that night of November 5th.”  
  
“Well, like she said I was havin a few rounds at the bowling alley. It was
late and I was gonna head on home. I didn't wanna drive cause I knew that
woulda been inresponsible ya know? So on my way home I got turned around.
Here's this nice enough gal to lemme use her phone to call a cab. Next thing I
knew, I was at her place with my clothes off. Its like she cast sum sorta
spell or sumthin! She decived me she did! You know dem gals, with their
dangerous ways! You said so yerself!”  
“Alex, do you usually get out of control, like you're doing right now?”  
There was a silence in the room. The sweat dripping from the bailiff's nose
was the only audible noise.  
“No! Of course I don't! I'm a man ain’t I! I have self control, I have
willpower and I ain’t never let my emotions weaken me!”  
“So the only other time you've felt this way was on that November 5th night?
Is that correct?”  
“Y—yes. That’s right.”  
“So in your entire life, the two instances in which your emotions were forced
out of control, this woman was present?”  
“Yeah!”  
“Would you say, Mr. Dam, that you are a victim of the unrelenting effects of a
woman and her emotion and not the criminal that she claims you are!?”  
“Yeah! It’s her! She's doing it to me!”  
“No further questions your Honor. And may I advise that we remove Mr. Dam from
the court room so he may seek medical assistance for whatever sort of
domination this woman has over him.”  
  
Grinning widely, the prosecutor returned to his seat to wait for the verdict
while just five feet away, Eve sat awestruck waiting for the same. The Judge
dismissed the jury and gave them time to make their decision, while reminding
them that it was getting close to 8 o'clock and that there was a game on
tonight. After what seemed like an eternity, the jury entered the room.  
  
“We find the defendant....guilty of all charges!”  
“WHAT!? NO! You can't do this to us! I'm going to have a baby! Don't you
understand that!?”  
“Order in my court!” The Judge banged his gavel several times  
“Order!”  
  
Eve threw the table in front of her over on its edge. She started for the
prosecutor, tears of rage streaming down her cheeks, red and engorged with
blood. An instant later and Eve would have reached her target, would have
strangled the man with her bare hands, would have torn at his chest so she
could pull out the heart that was not there. Only an instant. Instead the
guards got to Eve first. She broke free from one of their grasps and took the
gun from his holster. Cocked and aimed, Eve felt a movement in her abdomen.
She smiled and pulled the trigger.****
