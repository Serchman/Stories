"Let me in Charley! PLEASE!"

A small girl

Thin, terrified.

"Get the fuck out of here!"

He goes to slam the door.

She twists her way in.

"Charley Please, I'm in trouble!"

Tears begin.

"Tell me somethin' I give a shit about."

"Charley, I killed a guy"

Tears begin to flood.

She reaches over to hug him.

He pushes her roughly away.

"WHAT!"

She's stunned

She sits, hugs herself tightly

She whispers, almost to herself.

"I killed a man."

Tears begin to flood.

"Jesus Christ! What happened?"

"This guy, 'girlfriend told me 'bout him"

She begins trembling

"Good steady source if he likes you,"

" 'you're nice to him"

"She tells me where he hangs out, sometimes."

"So I go up there"

"Figure I'll hang out 'til he shows up."

"I'm still pretty good lookin'."

She looks over at Charley for reassurance.

He returns her gaze stonily.

She's faded

"Anyway I figure I got a shot."

"Well, I'm lucky, he's there when I walk in."

"I go up to him, mention my girlfriend."

"Try to sound cheerful. You know fun."

"But I'm in bad shape. I need a fix. Bad."

"He looks me up and down, coldly, sneering"

"The fucking cocksucker was SNEERING at me!"

"Christ Charley I've had to take a lot of shit lately."

"I guess he liked what he saw."

"Told me to go to this abandoned strip mall and wait."

"Wait. He'd come by when he got around to it."

"COME BY WHEN HE GOT AROUND TO IT. AND I’M SUPPOSE TO SIT BY AND WAIT!"

"But of course I did. I needed the fix."

"That's the kind of shit I have to take lately, Charley."

"Two hours later, TWO HOURS, he finally comes by."

"Me, sittin' there in the dark, trembling, can't stand it."

"He gets out of his Escalade"

"Leans against the hood".

" 'Get over here fast bitch, on your knees!' "

"Nasty, real nasty"

"Why are they so nasty Charley?"

"Big, powerful guy"

"And what am I?"

"Nothing"

"A skinny little nothing"

"No purpose for my existence"

"A disembodied wraith, floating,"

"floating in a sea of cock."

"waiting for my next fix ."

"I needed a fix bad Charley."

"I ran over, RAN so I wouldn't make him mad."

"A touch of hysteria as I had trouble with his belt."

"Then finally his cock, a big one sprang free."

"I was excited, determined Charlie,"

"I was determined to give him the best blow job he ever had."

"I wanted him to be my friend"

"Well....you know what I mean"

"I think it's going well, but then he starts pushing."

"Pushing it down"

"I can't handle deep throating under the best circumstances"

"And there he is FORCING it down!"

"I try to back away"

"But he twists my hair, locks me in, he's too strong, he continues to force it
down"

"I can't breathe"

"I'm flailing"

"Then at the last minute he releases me and pulls out"

"I lurch back' gasping"

"He's giggling! Giggling for Christ's sake,"

"he's having a good time!"

"At this point I'm crying."

" 'Get over here, you piece of shit "

" 'kneel in front of me' "

"I quickly crawl over"

" 'Face up. Look at me' "

"I do as he says."

"I don't want to make him mad"

"He jerks off on my face."

"He's still giggling"

"A sadistic giggle"

"He's having a ball."

"He turns to go back to his car"

"I panic"

"Please Mr. Carlucci"

"I'm whining now, pathetic."

"near hysteria"

"Can I have a fix? Please Mr Carlucci"

" 'Fuck you, slut.' "

"Nasty, vicious"

" 'I aint gonna' give you nuttin' "

"You wanna' fix go back downtown, peddle your skinny ass"

"Charley, I was strung out. Really strung out."

"I was like an animal"

"I sprung up screeching,"

" howling,"

"digging my nails into him"

"He pushed me away then hit me with his fist, hard."

"I went sprawling"

"But my bag went with me"

"My bag with the .38"

"I pulled it out."

"He looked at me, snickered"

"Like the situation was a joke"

"Started walking toward me."

"Leaned over, hand out"

" 'Gimme that fuckin' thing cunt' "

"Patronizing"

"I pulled the trgger"

"Kept pulling until it kept clicking."

"You had an unregistered firearm?"

Charley uses a very official police tone of voice

She looks at him confused.

"What's this crap Charley?"

"You know it was my Daddy's"

"it's all I have of his"

"I always carry it with me"

"It bonds me to him. He loved me Charley."

"I never sold it. No matter how bad things got I never sold it."

"Besides, you have at least two throwaways stashed here."

His eyes slit

"Christie , you know nothin' of the sort."

Threatening

"I'm sorry Charley. But I need your help!"

"You're a Cop. You know things."

"You can help me."

"All I can do is turn you in."

"You just confessed a murder to me!"

"A murder for fuck's sake."

"I could be convicted as an accessory."

"Don't say that Charley"

"We're friends. We go way back"

"A good lawyer. You'll get off. Self defense."

"Worst case basis, a few years, most."

"I can't go to prison Charley. I won't!"

"Did he have a gun.?"

"No. I searched him."

"I tore that fucking Escalade apart!"

"Six loud shots rang out in a quiet, empty mall"

"And you stayed there, calmly searching his car?"

"I wasn't calm. But I needed the fix! "

"I was looking desperately for his stash."

"and the cocksucker didn't have one!"

"He was planning to stiff me all along."

"Maybe he was going to pay you."

"He didn't though, did he?"

"I'm gonna' call this in."

Charley reaches for his phone."

"No ,wait Charlie!"

"There's something more."

She suddenly seems calmer.

Nervous, twitchy, but still a crafty calm about her

Charley stops.

Looks at her.

"Charley, I've been talking to God!"

Charley turns away, disgusted.

He pulls out his phone.

"No, no, please listen to me!"

"This is important!"

He puts away the phone

exasperated

"Make it quick."

"I told God I wanted to get clean"

"I really did and asked for his help."

"Charley, I want to get out "

"Go someplace nice, someplace quiet"

"God said he would help me."

He pulls out his phone

"I'm not interested in your screwball shit."

Starts to dial

She quickly blurts out

"There was over $200,000 in the Escalade!"

He stops dialing startled

"Jesus Christ!"

"God arranged it"

"God arranged for you to put six slugs into what's probably a guineau
mobster".

"You have no spiritual sense Charley, no soul."

"You're dead inside."

"Daddy talked to God about me, I'm sure of it."

"Where's the money?"

"I hid it"

"Nobody will find it."

She looks at Charley earnestly now.

"God told me to come to you Charley."

"That you would help me."

"We can split it"

"that still leaves me with enough to start fresh."

"Go someplace clean, decent"

"It can really happen."

"I can get clean now Charley"

"Start a new life."

Charley contemplates her.

Deep in thought.

Finally he smiles, begins to stand

"Ok Christie, let's go get the money"

Her heart leapt.

It was her Daddy

Her Daddy reached out and helped her.

It would be all right now.

Her Daddy loved her.

Charley is reaching down to open his car door.

"Hey Charley!"

He straightens up.

"Egan, how they hangin'"

"Y' know, same old shit. I'm workin' that hooker murder. Y' know, the one they
found in the dumpster, strangled. Heard you knew her."

"Yeah, haven’t seen her for a few years though. We went to high school
together. She was a nice kid back then, but moody, almost manic/depressive. A
sad situation. Her mother was an alcoholic, a real bum. Her father was her
rock. He got killed in an accident when she was twelve, and she seemed to
become untethered. We were tight during our senior year, then drifted apart.
You know how it is."

"Drugs?'

"Not then. Smoked some pot, you know" Charley shrugs. "Think we scored molly a
coupla' times. But then a few years later she comes to me, asks if she could
crash. Well Dotty had just walked out, so it sounded like a good idea. She'd
always been a nice kid. But what a fucking disaster it turned out to be! "

"Drugs?"

"Nah, she was just wacko. Into all this mystical other worldly shit. She was
living on uppers and downers. Told me she wanted to keep her spiritual
equilibrium. 'suppose that's as good an excuse as any. Though I did suspect
she may have been chasin' the Dragon. Why did you ask? Was she on the needle?"

"A fucking pin cushion! Badly scarred."

"That's too bad. She was a nice kid once. Anyway after about three weeks I
threw her out. She'd brought some low life home to the apartment while I was
at work. Jesus, I can't have some sleaze ball poking around my place! Last I
heard she'd hooked up with some nigger. She was one of those broads that
always seemed to need a man to lean on."

"Well, there were no humans involved so I'm not going to sweat it. That is
unless hookers start popping up dead on a regular basis."

"Yeah, well, see y' around"

Charley reaches over to open his car door.

"Hey man, cool wheels."

"Yeah, decided it was time I started takin' care of myself."
