**** Intro:** The Mortuary 

* * *

“Hallo?”  
A sleepy voice greeted me at two o’clock on Sunday morning. “Den Haan, get
dressed. I’ll pick you up in fifteen minutes.”  
There was a yawn – “Yes inspector I’ll be out side.”  
I smiled to myself, partly with amusement and partly because now I could make
her life as unpleasant or as comfortable as I wanted.  
*  
“It’s flippin’ cold out tonight, Inspector.” Den Haan blew on her hands once
she has slammed the mortuary van door shut. I remained silent. “Where are we
going?” she asked warily.  
“To pick up a body from a farm quite some way from here. There was a fight
among the farm labourers and one of them was stabbed several times.”  
“Oh,” Den Haan looked out of the window, although it was pitch dark.
“Inspector – I just want to explain…I didn’t realise…”  
“No you didn’t. You didn’t realise in asking for an outside job you’d be
working with me. Here’s how it’s going to work. I am going to treat you
fairly, so long as you do your job. I will not hold your outright flattery of
and flirtation with my husband against you. So do your job and there won’t be
any problems.”  
“I just wanted to say…”  
“We are now working, concentrate on the work. Your extra-mural activities do
not form part of my department so leave them where you normally carry them out
– on parade, in the charge office and at station parties.”  
There was silence until we reach the scene of the murder.  
“Inspector,” Den Haan gasped when she saw the obese man lying in the beams of
the mortuary van headlights. “He’s so big how we are going to get him on the
stretcher.  
“I’m sure you will manage just fine.”  
“Me on my own?” Her mouth fell open and as much as I would have liked to have
kept a straight face, I started to laugh.  
“We’ll find some people to help us. This is your first body collection – never
be afraid to ask for assistance from onlookers. If they have enough time to
stare in morbid curiosity then they can bloody well help. Always ask for
help.”  
*  
With the help of some of the farm labourers we loaded the deceased man into
the back of the mortuary van and began a two hour journey back to the police
station.  
“What are you doing?” Den Haan had pulled out her deodorant spray and was
squirting deodorant around the cab. “Stop it!” I grabbed the deodorant from
her.  
“The body stinks.”  
“Of course it does, he was stabbed in the stomach and intestine area. Now you
know what we all smell like inside.” Her eyes grew round and her hand flew up
to her mouth.  
“Inspector, I think I am going to be sick.”  
“Don’t you dare be sick inside this vehicle. Stick your head out of the
window.”  
“But it’s cold.”  
“I don’t care. Wind down your window and breath in the cold fresh air.”  
She leant out of the window, gulping in cold air through her mouth whilst she
pinch her nose shut. I smile to myself, as a sense of deep satisfaction
flooded through me.  
“Inspector?”  
“Mm-hm.”  
“How do you do this job? It’s so gross.”  
“Do it long enough and you don’t even smell the bodies anymore.”  
She nodded before sticking her head out of the window again.  
*  
“What do we do now?”  
We stood beside the corpse on the adjustable trolley in the mortuary.  
“We? No – you. The key word here is you. You are going to take any personal
items you find on him and place them in a brown envelope and mark it with the
same number that is on the tag I have just placed on his toe. You are then
going to strip him down to his underwear and tuck his hands inside his
underwear.”  
She started to laugh. “Why would I do that? Oh - this is some joke you’re
playing on me so you can tell it at one of the station parties.”  
I gave her a blank stare and remained silent.  
“It is - isn’t it?” Her discomfort showed.  
“Soon rigor mortis is going to set in. In this weather it will be sooner
rather than later. The limbs might do funny things. Sticking the hands in the
underwear stops the arms rising up or bending at the elbow. If you don’t
believe me look in the fridges.”  
I went to my office to get documentation leaving her to carry out the
instructions I had given her. I retuned to the mortuary but stopped at the
door as a wonderful scene played out before me. Den Haan was having a tug of
war with the man’s trousers and underwear. If she could have taken both items
of clothing off it would have been easy but she was trying to hold the
underwear in place with one hand while pulling the trousers off with the
other. Her pale face from the ride back to the station had been replaced by a
flushed crimson colour from her exertion. A determined look was etched on her
face.  
“How’s it going?”  
“Well,” she stood back her hand on her hips as she viewed him critically. I’m
battling to get his trousers off. His top and his personal effects are over
there on the counter.” She began tackling his trousers again. Grunting as she
pulled with all her might.  
I watched her from the counter as I began to fill in the forms.  
“This is useless!” she exploded. “He’s too bloody heavy and fat.”  
“What did I tell you early tonight?”  
“I am trying to do my job.”  
“I’m not talking about that. When we were on the farm and you wanted to know
how we were going to get him in the van,” I prompted.  
“Oh – always ask for help and use bystanders.”  
“Well.”  
“Well what?”  
“Why haven’t you done so?  
“There’s only you and me here.”  
“Yes and - ? Bystanders aren’t always civilians.”  
Den Haan sighed. “Inspector, will you help me get his whale of a man’s
trousers off? Please.”  
“Of course.”  
Working together the trousers came off quickly and he was ready to be placed
in the fridge.  
“Den Haan, run up to the front gate and get three of the policemen on guard
duty to come and help us maneuver this man into the fridge.”  
“Yes Inspector.” The relief on her face to be escaping from the mortuary even
if it was for just a few minutes was clear.  
*  
“Inspector, they’re here.” I looked up from the nearly completed forms.  
“Right each of you takes a corner of the slab then ease him into the middle
fridge. He’s heavy so be ready to take his weight.” After making sure they
knew what was expected I returned to the paper work. I began the final form.  
I, Inspector van Staden, state under oath in English that since this body came
into my possession it sustained no further damage…”  
Burp! Fart! Crash!  
I looked up to find myself alone in the mortuary with the deceased man and
slab hanging at an awkward angle from the middle fridge. Den Haan and the
three gate guards were no where to be seen. I walked over to the body and
viewed it critically. Some blood was escaping from the nose, ears and mouth.  
“Damn, that’s all I need.”  
Returning to the counter I tore the final form and replaced it with another
one.  
I, Inspector van Staden state under oath in English that since the body came
into my possession it sustained further damage due to it being dropped while
being eased into the fridge…  
I stopped writing and decided to go for a walk. I made my way to the gate
house where some very pale looking policemen and Den Haan were smoking.  
“Den Haan, you don’t smoke.”  
“Oh boy Inspector, I do now. We almost put a comatose person in the fridges
among the dead.” The other policemen vigorously nodded their heads.  
I started to smile but bit my lower lip.  
“I can assure you that that man is not alive. When you are dead, your
sphincters relax and air inside the body can escape. You can be glad that his
bowels weren’t full otherwise you would have had that to contend with too.”  
“Uh-huh. No way.” Den Haan was shaking and pointed in the direction of the
mortuary. “Inspector, with all due respect, there is no way I can work in this
department.”  
“It means going back to an office job.”  
“I don’t mind. I’ll wait until an opening in another department comes up.”  
“Sure?”  
“Sure."

"I still need help to get the body in the fridge.”  
Reluctantly, the gate guards and Den Haan returned to the mortuary to help me
put the man in the fridge.
