"There comes a time when silence is betrayal... I knew I could never again
raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettoes, without
having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world
today- my own government."  
-Martin Luther King Jr.

12:15am  
605 BRIGGS STREET  
SOUTH SAN ANTONIO  
FRIDAY NOVEMBER 9, 1984.  
  
Harold Williams stood behind the police tape which cordoned off the house.
Earl, his cameraman, stood behind him ready to shoot. He was licking his lips,
a botched robbery, horrific murder and miracle survival. Compelling,
confounding news. Even better, the culprits had escaped- they were on the
loose and could be anywhere! This stuff was sweeps material. Make it scary
enough and the major networks would pick it up, and he would get a fat bonus.  
"Earl? You ready to roll?"  
"Right when you are Harry." Harold thought for a moment. Looking over he saw
Officer Joe De La Luz huddling in a squad car, hugged by a large jacket and
avoiding the early winter air. Harry walked over and tapped on the window. Joe
hesitated before winding it down.  
"Harry, you know I can't tell you nothing but what's on the brief." He said
duly.  
"Yeah we know Joe, but ah... got a lot of potential to be a very big story,
national, full networks. You reckon you'd be able to flash the siren for us?
No sounds, just lights."  
Joe smiled. A flick of a switch and the night sky was painted in flashes of
blue and red, the atmosphere of a siege. Action.  
  
"I'm standing outside what appears to be the scene of a horrific and barbaric
murder/robbery in Briggs Street, South San Antonio. Although the Bexar County
Sheriff John Neaves was unable to comment, he did release a brief only minutes
ago providing a basic insight into the situation.  
  
It appears as though approximately one hour ago two men were sleeping inside
the house, when they were robbed and then shot repeatedly." (He didn't mention
they were Mexican immigrants- the viewers would lose interest) "Neighbours,
awoken by shots and screams, witnessed two teenagers of Hispanic appearance
fleeing the scene armed with a rifle. Local police are still scouring the
area. Residents are warned that the suspects are still at large.  
  
The ferocity and the barbaric nature of the attacks have shocked the police-
both victims were shot at least eight times. One of the victims, a twenty five
year old man, was found dead at the scene. Another man survived the vicious
attack. He remains in critical condition in hospital.  
  
Police advise the public to be on the lookout for two young Hispanic males,
between the ages of 14 and 18. Should you encounter the perpetrators you
should alert police immediately and avoid approaching them as they are armed
and considered extremely dangerous."  
  
And cut. Behind the camera Earl gave the thumbs up. This was hard hitting,
shocking and confronting.  
"Screw standing in the cold Earl... let's go home." Harry had had enough. Joe
wound down his window again as they walked back to their van. Harry obligingly
slipped him a $20 note. A worthwhile investment.  
  
  
8:30pm  
SCABAROO LOUNGE  
SOUTH SAN ANTONIO  
FRIDAY MARCH 1, 1985.  
  
Ruben Cantu watched the fight from a pool table across the room through the
smokey haze of cigarette smoke. Beside him stood his older brother, Robert,
the end of his pool stick resting against his huge chest, unaware as the chalk
streaked its signature blue across his black shirt. The Scabaroo Lounge was a
dimly-lit local bar where the two Cantu brothers played pool together every
Friday night. They did everything together, sharing a close brotherly bond
despite the five year age difference. Robert had grown up looking out for his
little brother, who was slightly smaller than others his age and puny compared
to Robert.  
  
On the other side of the room a glass smashed as it was knocked from the bar.
A man flew from his seat and tackled the man beside him, dragging him to the
floor in a drunken rage. Minutes previously they had been best mates, and
truth be told, half an hour and another beer would see them friends once
again. Something that trivial would never get in the way of their friendship,
and the next night it would be back-slaps and beers all round.  
  
Robert's cigarette burnt down to the butt as they watched the melee unfold
before them. Another loud shout caught their attention. The other man was on
top. A wild, mistimed loping punch caught him on the head as another mate
joined in the fight. The bar dissolved into a brawl as men drunkenly picked
sides and punched on with the man standing beside them. Ruben laughed and
Robert choked on his smoke after attempting to inhale and getting a lungful of
burning filter. Examining the butt between thumb and finger he grimaced before
throwing it to the floor and snuffing it with his very large black boot.  
"Rube?" Robert paused and lit his next smoke, cupping it in his huge hands,
"ese, you ever get sick of all this?"  
"Nope." Ruben didn't even look away from the fight. Instead he watched the
barman feebly pull one of the men out of the brawl and try to diffuse the
situation.  
"Why?"  
"Ese, it's simple. We're always fighting. I can spend my Friday night out
there," motioning to the streets, "risk getting shot-up by the Chinos, or come
here and watch a bunch of wife-beating, washed up white trash fight over
something as dumb as football. At least we fight for something."  
  
Robert laughed again, his brother had a point. Their gang, the Grey Eagles,
known as the GE's, weren't just a group of boys throwing rocks. Born from the
harsh streets of South San Antonio, a slum of Hispanic poverty, it had an
affiliation with notorious Mexican gang Mara Salvatrucha, MS-13, and had a
reputation built on fierce loyalty. The GE's revenue came from their
carjacking operations, a network which spread across the state. They would
break into cars, hotwire them and then run the gauntlet to the border, where
they would sell them to the MS-13 to be 'rebirthed'. Ruben was the best. From
his first 'run' at age 14 his talent was obvious. He had a cool-yet-ruthless
temperament and a peerless ability. He quickly matured into a fine leader. His
rise through the ranks was meteoric, rapidly surpassing the established
gangsters in the hierarchy, his brother included. He was now the undisputed
leader of the GE's and epitomised everything the gang stood for.  
  
However Ruben was dealing with times like none before him had ever seen. The
hornet's nest had been stirred when one of the younger gang members, Ramiro
Reyes, had shot two Mexican immigrants on Briggs Street. Ramiro and another
boy, David Garza, had broken into a house and were robbing the two occupants
of their cash and wristwatches when Ramiro saw a gun and over-reacted. As
Garza later described to Ruben, Ramiro just snapped and shot them both. One
died, somehow the other survived.  
  
Many within the gang felt that they should give the boys up to save the Grey
Eagles. Ruben disagreed. Instead he put his gun to the head of the main
dissident and quoted the creed tattooed on all of their chests. Silence 'til
Death.  
"So Ese, you got a choice. Stay silent or become dead. Simple."  
Debate over the issue died then and there. The problems for the gang didn't.  
  
The trouble started at the same time as the murder. Another local gang, The
Chinos, had begun to bludgeon themselves a slice of GE territory as the
temptation of drug spoils abolished any previous agreement over boundaries.
The GE's made a pittance from the drug trade. Ruben maintained that a strong
gang must have the trust and respect of those in their community. He argued
that if they peddled drugs that trust would be burnt like the crack that
filled the addicts' pipes.  
  
The Chinos weren't averse to using force to achieve their objectives. Many in
the GE's had fallen victim to their violent methods. Some returned to their
homes to find the facade riddled with bullets. A carload of hoodlums in white
singlets and yellow bandannas would speed into the street and, slowing down as
they approached the target's house, hang out the windows and fire wildly
before speeding off cackling like hyenas.  
  
Others fared much worse. The Chinos would track down a GE's house, stalk him,
and in the dead of the night smash their way into the victim's house. A storm
of pain would follow as they, masked and wielding baseball bats, mercilessly
pummelled their target and ransacked the house. The floors became abstract
collages, entwining colours formed by the shards of shattered objects.
Priceless photos, in broken frames and cracked glass, left next to the
remnants of bongs and crack pipes; symbols of gangsters' warped morals.  
  
Ruben looked across at his brother. He knew Robert wouldn't be there to
protect him forever, it was only a matter of time. He had begun taking
precautions. Protection came in the form of a .44 Magnum tucked into the front
of his pants, its thick black butt jutting out menacingly. A reminder to
others that he was packing.  
  
§§§§§§§  
  
Back across the room the melee had settled down. The middle-aged, overweight
white men couldn't sustain a brawl for more than two minutes. Slowly they
began pulling themselves to their feet, picking up the upturned bar stools as
they breathed heavily and reached for cigarettes.  
  
The barman resumed his position behind the bar, his white towel draped over
his neck and his huge hairy arms folded across his black shirt. He breathed
deeply. He hated the bar. He hated his patrons. Their senseless alcohol-
fuelled violence shed blood on his tortured soul. His eyes moved to the small
print of an old cottage tacked to the wall above the sink. In the background
behind the cottage was an orchard of citrus trees. He imagined himself beside
the cottage, tending to a petite vegetable patch. He toiled in the dazzling
sunlight, the sky blue overhead, and breathing fresh air. It soothed his lungs
which ached from the acidic air in the bar. He stopped for a moment and wiped
the salty sweat from his brow before continuing, his hoe slicing into the
ground and upheaving great sods of damp earth.  
"Yo! Oi Barman, grab us two beers." At the other end of the bar the uneasy
harmony was disrupted by a loud, obnoxious and intoxicated middle aged man who
shoved himself a place against the bar. The barman stared at him with disdain.
It was men like him who made his entrapment, his slavery, so unbearable. As he
poured the drinks he gazed longingly at the image above the sink. Pangs of
desperation tugged like an impatient child on its mother's shirt tails. He had
to escape.  
"One day..." he said to himself, staring at his picture.  
  
The man carried both drinks over to a table, handing one to his friend before
gulping down his own, dribbles of beer splashing the front of his jacket.  
  
§§§§§§§  
  
Ruben was poised on the verge of victory. Only the waiting eight ball sat
between him and triumph. The game wasn't particularly competitive, they never
were, but it was always nice to defeat an older sibling. He leant over the
table as he lined the shot up, focused on the white ball. He drew the cue back
slowly, and it struck the angry man from the bar. The man lurched forward, his
beer slopping down the front of his jacket.  
"What the fuck do you think you're doing?" His face was contorted with rage,
fists curled into tight white balls as he looked down at the seeping stain on
the front of his shirt.  
His friend stepped in and grabbed a handful of the man's jacket. He preferred
to avoid senseless confrontation.  
"Joe, come on, the kid didn't mean it." He reasoned, but Joe was too drunk to
listen.  
"Bullshit Brad! Dirty little wetback." He strained against Brad's grip.  
Robert jumped in between Joe and Ruben, his huge frame shielding Ruben.  
"Look mister," Robert's tone was low and assertive, "he didn't mean it. We
don't want any trouble."  
"My shirt! You bastard." He screamed, drunkenly pointing and waving. His
jacket slid back slightly. Two pistols were holstered against his body.
Adrenaline buzzed through Ruben. Cautiously he thumbed the safety off on his
own gun.  
  
"Come on mate. Let's just go." Brad grabbed Joe and directed him towards the
door. Joe appeared to have settled down. His voice was no longer an enraged
shout embellished by his rampant temper, rather just a drunken slur as they
went to leave. Robert looked at Ruben and breathed a sigh of relief. He too
had seen the guns swinging proudly from their holsters, ready to spray like a
beer tap.  
  
A commotion broke out across the room as a pool table skidded across the
floor. The beers perched on its edge fell and smashed. Ruben spun to find Joe
whipping both guns from their holsters. His eyes exuded drunken lust,
insanity. A madness of uncertainty. Spittle flew from his mouth as he yelled
commands. Ruben could see him shouting, his mouth mashing. It was like he was
at a rock concert, he couldn't hear anything above the noise. The gun in Joe's
right hand pointed straight at Robert's chest. The other pistol, gripped in
the left, was aimed at the bar. Bodies and objects went diving for the floor.
Fifty-two card pickup.  
  
Joe glared intently at Robert, eyes narrowed in tunnelled rage. His finger
caressed the trigger. Robert's life hung in its drunken balance.  
  
BAM! BAM! Two shots rang out. The thud of hot metal penetrating human flesh
ricocheted off the walls.  
  
For seconds not a soul moved. Nothing made a noise except the soft music
playing eerily in the background. Time stalled, one continuous moment in
eternity. For that moment only the Scabaroo Lounge existed in the universe.  
  
§§§§§§§  
  
Tom, a regular at the bar, was the first to glance up from the floor. He knew
one of the two Hispanic brothers would be lying dead in a pool of blood,
probably the larger one. He always seemed to be protecting the younger
brother. He didn't know them, but they were often at the bar. They kept to
themselves, didn't cause problems.  
  
He was wrong. Joe was lying on the floor, his arms and legs spreadeagled.
Expanding circles of crimson gushed through his shirt. His throat let forth a
bloody gargle; gnarled and ailing. The younger brother was standing over the
body, his gun smoking. It was still aimed Joe. The menacing face sent a simple
message- reach for your gun and you're dead.  
  
§§§§§§§  
  
Time slowed for Robert as he heard the gun blast. He stood still in the
anticipation of his death. He heard the bullets wallop into flesh, tearing
gapes through tissue. Looking down he expected to see his body riddled with
lead-pierced holes, for life to gush from them like air from a balloon.
Instead, nothing.  
  
A crashing sound made him look up, just in time to see Joe's body collapse to
the floor, his head hitting the hard timber floor with a sickening smack.  
  
Ruben stood still, his pistol still pointing at Joe.  
  
Slowly people began pulling themselves to their feet. For Ruben everything was
veiled in haze. A call went out for someone to call 911. Others hurried to the
body on the floor, kneeling in the pooled blood spewing from Joe's chest.
Everyone rushed about, although most of them did nothing.  
A man came and stood next to Ruben, who was leaning against a wall, slumped,
in shock.  
"You want a ciggie?"he offered. His matted grey hair and weathered blue eyes
gave an image of understanding, perhaps even compassion.  
Ruben grunted and begrudgingly took one, cupping it with his hands as he
sparked it up.  
"You know boy, it's gonna be okay," he reassured him.  
Ruben breathed deeply and the man steadied him with a firm hand on the
shoulder.  
"We all saw what happened, you did... you did the right thing."  
  
"Roy, you might wanna see this." One of the men kneeling beside Joe called.
The old man beside Ruben moved forward.  
"I'll be right back." He walked over and squatted beside the body, "What?" The
other man didn't say a word, he just handed him Joe's wallet.  
"Shit!"  
"...Yep."  
In the wallet was a small piece of polished metal, a badge, the shield of the
South San Antonio Police Department.  
  
Roy walked back over to Ruben, and passed him the wallet. His jaw dropped as
he read the badge. He had shot Officer Joe De La Luz.  
"If I were you, son, I'd get out of here." Roy looked at the boy intently.  
He didn't respond, so Roy turned to Robert, pleading with him to get his
brother out of town.  
Ruben interjected sharply.  
"No. I'm not running. I ain't done nothing wrong. He tried to kill my
brother."  
"We know, but it doesn't matter. It's different now. Yeah, he was going to
shoot one of you and in the same position we would all do the same, but," Roy
looked Ruben straight in the eyes, "he was a cop. They aren't gonna believe
you, or us. They'll pin you for this and you'll go for life."  
  
The shrieking of sirens rang out in the distance, every second drawing them
nearer. Ruben's prospect of escaping was shrinking drastically with every
passing moment, yet he stood solid in the storm of panic around him. People
begged him to leave, to run to the border. The waste of such a young life was
unnecessary they argued. His reply was silence. He pulled open his shirt to
reveal the Grey Eagle creed tattooed boldly across his chest:  
Silence 'til Death.  
Robert buried his head in his hands.  
The sirens grew closer. They rounded the corner, the red and blue flashes
streaked through the windows. The chance of escape had vanished. Roy looked at
Ruben, his aged eyes welling with tears of compassion. He placed his hand back
on Ruben's shoulder and said, "Good luck kid."  
  
  
11:30pm  
SERGEANT BILL EWELL'S RESIDENCE  
SOUTH SAN ANTONIO  
FRIDAY MARCH 1, 1985.  
  
The phone. Somewhere between the empty bottle of whiskey, the overfilled
ashtray spewing butts and a rolled up $20 bill its piercing ring shattered
Sergeant Bill Ewell's drunken slumber. Disorientated, his head pressed face-
down into his pillow, his left arm flailed in the air above the bedside table,
fingers desperately grasping the receiver.  
"....what?" he murmured. The pillow stifled his words.  
"Bill, is that you?"  
"Yeah... who's this and why the hell are you calling me at this hour?"  
"It's John Daley, from the Precinct. We got a big problem."  
  
Bill's jaw dropped. The phone almost fell from his hand as John told him what
had happened.  
"The Doc said he'd probably pull though. Surgery went fine."  
"Who did it?" he demanded.  
"Cantu," he replied, "Ruben."  
Bill exploded upon hearing the boy's name.  
"Fuck! I knew we should have fingered that little bastard for the Briggs St
Murder when we had the chance. Where is he? He's at the station? I'm gonna
kill that son-of-a-bitch!"  
  
His eyes were bulging from their sockets as he shouted down the phone. His
muscles were taut and shaking. Beads of sweat formed in the deep furrows of
his enraged brow. He and Joe had been friends for years. Bill was his superior
officer down at the Precinct and together they had worked on a number of
cases. On more than one occasion, when he hadn't been too busy getting himself
out of trouble, he had stuck his neck out to cover for his mate against
allegations of assault, drunkenness and obstruction of justice. Joe always
seemed to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  
  
  
  
  
10:30am  
SOUTH SAN ANTONIO POLICE DEPARTMENT  
SATURDAY MARCH 2, 1985  
  
Bill sat behind his desk in the South San Antonio Police Station and stared
intently at the officers and detectives assembled in front of him. They had
just returned from the hospital where Joe had regained consciousness after the
surgery and they were ready to go after Cantu.  
"Okay. Neddy you were at the scene last night, how did you go with statements?
Any good ones?"  
"Ah, no good chief. They all said the same thing... Joe was threatening to
shoot Cantu's older brother Robert and Ruben shot him. They reckon it was self
defence," replied Ned Anderson, a cunning Senior Detective.  
"Shit!" Bill yelled and with his right arm swept his coffee off the desk. His
chest was heaving as he put his reddened face into his hands and stared at the
desk. Gradually his breathing slowed and he asked the men to wait outside. He
needed some advice.  
"Neddy, stay in here and pull the blinds down."  
  
The other officers stood outside and waited for fifteen minutes. No one
talked, they just waited anxiously. Eventually the door opened and Neddy stuck
his head out and motioned for them to come back inside. Bill was still sitting
behind the desk and Neddy sat on the corner of the table facing them.  
"So, first things, we're re-opening the Brigg St Murder." Bill was smiling, it
was the perverted smirk he did when he fancied himself in control. Neddy spoke
up.  
"Santos and Edward, you guys are going to visit Juan Moreno. He was the guy
who survived the shooting and it was his brother-in-law, Pedro Lopez that
died."  
Detective James Herring raised his voice in protest, but Bill cut him off.  
"Yeah I know James, it was your case, but we need to change our approach."  
"But he's failed to ID Cantu in two photo line-ups, what makes you think we'll
get him this time?"  
"This is why we have to do something different, we'll do another photo line-
up. If that doesn't work, we'll bring him in. I'll help him remember." His
eyes narrowed.  
James knew better than to push, it wasn't worth his job.  
"Fine. So what do you want me to do?"  
Bill looked at him without replying and pushed an envelope across the table.
James picked it up and read the front. It was addressed to Alonso Fedoras, the
leader of the Chinos.  
"Take this over right away, then come straight back and see me."  
James left the room and Bill shifted his attention to the others.  
"Now, the rest of you, we have to deal with Cantu."  
"So you want us to get a confession?" asked Tom Hastings, cracking his
knuckles.  
Bill just shook his head.  
"No thanks Tom, not this time. This time we're gonna do it different, no
bruises." The men were confused. Usually when they had to nab someone for a
crime and they weren't 'co-operating' they would just 'interrogate' the person
until they got a confession.  
"I want you guys to go and search Cantu's place for evidence."  
What did they expect to find in the house? It was hardly a planned attack.  
"Have we got a warrant?" Tom enquired.  
"No."  
"So then what are we supposed to do with what we find? Won't it just damage
the case?"  
Bill smiled at them,  
"Just go and do it."  
  
  
1:00pm  
MORENO RESIDENCE,  
SOUTH SAN ANTONIO  
SATURDAY MARCH 2, 1985.  
  
Detective Santos 'Sam' Balleza spread seven mug-shots out across the coffee
table, all potential suspects in the Briggs St murder.  
"You recognise any of these men?"enquired Detective Edward Quantinilla. He and
Sam were sitting in Eusebio Moreno's lounge room on an old two-seater couch.
Opposite them Juan sat on a battered lazy-boy with his brother standing beside
him Juan studied the photos intently. His eyes strained as they scanned faces
in hope of triggering a distant recollection, a lost feature of a faceless
memory. It was futile.  
"I'm sorry officers, he just isn't here." Juan pushed the photos away and sat
back. His brother placed a comforting arm over his shoulder as the distressed
tremors returned.  
  
It had been just under five months since his brother-in-law, Pedro, had been
murdered and Juan left to die. He had lost a lung, a kidney and half of his
small intestine. He still suffered night terrors. The faceless shooter would
return in his sleep, the blasts from his rifle shattering his dreams,
startling him awake gripped by fear and drenched in sweat. Sometimes he would
awake in a panic, convinced the boy was in the house, that he'd had come back
to finish the job.  
  
Sam nodded at Juan before pushing the photo of Ruben back across the table for
re-examination, "Are you sure?" For a moment Juan studied the photo closely,
unsure.  
"Yeah, that isn't the guy."  
  
"Don't worry," Edward exclaimed as the two detectives walked back to the squad
car, "we'll get him."  
Sam was doubtful.  
"Do you reckon he'll ever remember?"  
"Who? Moreno?" Edward laughed, "Not a hope. Doesn't matter though, we know who
did it right?"  
Sam forced a laugh. Inside he wasn't so sure.  
  
  
2:30pm  
SOUTH SAN ANTONIO POLICE DEPARTMENT  
SATURDAY MARCH 2, 1985.  
  
The interview room was small, cramped, dim and damp. A small cold metal and
concrete cube, its only features were a blue door, a steel table bolted to the
floor and three aluminium chairs, lit by a solitary fluorescent globe. Traces
of blood, crimson against the gaunt grey floor and walls, spattered across the
room. Red rivulets coalesced with the water still pooled on the floor, slowly
trickling to the small drain in the corner.  
  
Ruben and his lawyer sat uncomfortably at the steel table discussing their
options. Harold Mathews was an older, small-firm lawyer. He wore thick rimmed
glasses with his dark grey hair combed across his head, and an old beige suit,
one that appeared as though it was fashioned from a discarded lounge chair. He
wasn't fantastic, but the gang didn't have much money stowed way. With the
little money they had he was simply the best that they could afford.  
  
Harold's weathered brief case sat open on the table. Beside it was a pile of
documents they were discussing. Bail was a forlorn prospect. The police would
ensure it wasn't granted, even if it required an anonymous and generous
charitable donation to someone's re-election campaign slush fund.  
  
Harold, however, was confident Ruben would beat the charges. The witness's
statements were consistent in corroborating that Ruben had acted in self
defence, and there was no physical evidence to suggest otherwise. The illegal
raid on Ruben's residence that morning, as fruitless as it was warrantless,
had tainted the prosecution's already flimsy case with an array of breaches in
official procedure. As it stood, the lack of substantiating evidence to
support the charge of Attempted Murder against Ruben would see the case
dismissed at the Committal Hearing. It failed to fulfil the prima facie
requisite necessary for trial. The police would be outraged, complaining
bitterly of a lack of justice, but they knew better than to push a judge too
far. Presented with a case such as Ruben's, a judge who failed to dismiss the
charges would risk the State Attorney ordering an independent inquest into the
handling of the case, and that could bring their ambitious career plans to an
abrupt halt.  
  
7:00pm  
REYES RESIDENCE  
SOUTH SAN ANTONIO  
SATURDAY MARCH 2, 1985.  
  
Ramiro Reyes unlocked the front door of his house. Inside the lights were off
and he heard no voices. Obviously his parents weren't home. That wasn't
unusual. His father was a long-haul truckie along the Interstate 10, which
often entailed driving coast-to-coast, from Santa Monica in California to
Jacksonville in Florida. His mother didn't work, she just disappeared for days
at a time.  
  
"Fuck!" A cold pistol barrel was pressed against his temple. A hand patted
down his sides, feeling for a weapon.  
"Lounge room, now!" A voice commanded. As he walked the gun traced around to
the back of his head, coming to rest in the nape of his neck.  
"Sit." Ramiro obediently sat down on the lounge. The man seated himself on a
chair, put his feet up on the side of the lounge and removed his balaclava. A
tumble of thick hair emerged. Ernesto Lopez.  
Ramiro recognised the face from the faint light emanating out of the kitchen.  
  
Ernesto was a well-known and feared member of the Chinos, strong, ruthless and
loyal. He certainly wasn't someone you wanted to have in your lounge room, let
alone pointing a gun at your head.  
  
Ramiro felt a hand on each shoulder, firm like a vice. Looking up he saw two
heavies, one on each side.  
  
A cackle broke out and Alonso Fedoras, the Chinos leader, emerged from a veil
of darkness. Sitting on the opposite lounge he took the cigarette from his
mouth and stubbed it out on the carpet.  
"Don't worry Ramiro, we're just here to offer you protection." Alonso's bright
white teeth shone as he chortled. It unsettled Ramiro. He forced a smile, "Ah
OK," he replied, "and what exactly do I need protection from?"  
"The Cantu brothers, Grey Eagles in general." Alonso reached into his pocket
and pulled out a number of photos which he spread along the table in between
them. He nodded his head, signalling for Ramiro to look.  
  
Ramiro laughed. The pictures weren't anything serious. A few images of him
talking to Officer Herring and then shaking his hand. It wouldn't be good for
his reputation but it wasn't something that got you shot. Ruben would tell him
to be more careful in future, but not much more.  
"You're not serious? I was talking to a cop, so what?"  
"True. But I'll bet Robert Cantu thinks differently when he finds out you
fingered his little brother for murdering that Wetback last year" Alonso
stared at Ramiro, searching for a reaction.  
"What?"Ramiro was shocked, stunned, "But he's in trouble for shooting the cop
last night, not that murder," he stammered nervously. Beads of sweat formed on
his forehead.  
  
The other three men laughed. Alonso paused and lit a cigarette.  
"Are you sure?" he sucked in deeply before puffing the smoke out in a stream
towards Ramiro. "It seems that following the unfortunate incident involving
Officer De La Luz last night new evidence has come to light in regards to the
Briggs St Murder. The case has been re-opened and Ruben Cantu is the prime
suspect."  
"But, but it wasn't Ruben. He was in Waco," Ramiro replied stutteringly. He
shrank back into the couch.  
"So?"  
"He couldn't have done it, he wasn't here. And besides, I- I was the one who
shot those Mexicans," Ramiro cracked, his face in his hands.  
  
Another laugh erupted.  
"What and you think we didn't already know that?" Ernesto's deep voice mocked.  
"And besides," Alonso added, "we don't care who did what. So here are your
options..."  
  
Ramiro was instructed to go to the police and make a statement claiming Ruben
told him he committed the Briggs Street Murder, and the Chinos would ensure he
would be protected. Otherwise, as they motioned at the photos still on the
table, they would send a copy to the Cantu brothers and "let them decide his
fate." Ramiro squirmed in his seat. Why not? Ruben was gone regardless, the
police were going to make sure he went away for life. He didn't want to die.
Not for this. Not for anyone.  
  
Ernesto suddenly got up and left the room, returning with a black sports bag.  
"What's in there?" Ramiro nodded nervously at the bag.  
"The bag? Nothing much, just something to assist with your decision."  
  
The heavies on either side jumped on him. He struggled futilely against the
vice-like grip of his assailants. Ernesto ripped off his shirt and removed a
silver object from the bag. Ramiro strained to see what it was, his view
blocked by a large hairy arm. A machine whirred into life, emitting the high-
pitched whine of a mosquito. The man's arm moved, revealing a tattoo gun, its
pincers ready to gnaw into exposed human flesh, Ramiro's exposed flesh.  
  
The butt of a pistol smashed into the side of his head. Searing pain, blinding
bright light, dizziness and then descending darkness as he faded into
unconsciousness.

REYES RESIDENCE  
SOUTH SAN ANTONIO  
SUNDAY MARCH 3  
  
Sun streaked into the room through the window bathing Ramiro's body in autumn
warmth. An armoury of pain jolted his body as his eyes creaked open to the
blinding light. He was lying stomach down on the couch were the Chinos had
left him. Turning his head he gazed at the state of the living room.  
  
Like the brown leaves of the season, everything was upturned and thrown across
the floor. His right arm throbbed. It felt raw, inflamed and bruised. Casting
his eyes down, he saw black lines streaked boldly against his angry red skin.
The lines scurried, forming an image. He squinted as the blurriness dissipated
and the lines began to link coherently. The image was now clear. It was a
jackal, the symbol of the Chinos.  
  
Ramiro felt sick, scared.  
  
He wanted to go to the GE's, explain to them what had happened, the attack,
the tattoo, the police working with the Chinos. He had to warn them.  
  
But what if they didn't believe him? Even worse, what if they made him
confess?  
  
Panic engulfed him. If the GE's didn't believe his story they would kill him,
or at least expel him from the gang, and then what? The Chinos would kill him.
They would hunt him down, put a bullet in his head and dump his body in the
marshes out by Calaveras Lake.  
  
No, he could never go back to the GE's now. Even if the gang showed mercy,
Robert surely wouldn't; he committed the crime their brother was going to fry
for.  
  
He had never actually 'talked' to the police. He had walked out of Taco Bell
to find Detective Herring standing beside the cruiser waiting for him. Herring
asked him what he knew about the shooting. Ramiro denied knowing anything and
the conversation ended. Then as he went to leave, Herring shook his hand. The
subsequent pictures told a completely different story, but a story
nonetheless.  
  
His attention was drawn to the coffee table, the only object in the room not
overturned or strewn across the floor. A lone scrap of paper sat upon it, a
phone number and a name scrawled in red.  
'Sergeant Ewell- (210)207-7273.'  
He found the phone in the kitchen and dialled the number.

SOUTH SAN ANTONIO POLICE DEPARTMENT  
MONDAY MARCH 4, 1985.  
  
Sergeant Ewell entered the interview room carrying two styrofoam cups and
flicked the door shut with his foot. Juan Moreno sat quietly at the table. He
nodded nervously as the coffee was placed in front of him, "Sir, I don't drink
coffee."  
Bill ignored him, instead lighting up a cigarette and plonking his feet on the
table. Blowing a line of smoke in Juan's direction, he placed a photo under
his nose, "Recognise him?" he asked.  
Another photo of Ruben. Juan examined the photo whilst waving away the smoke.  
"I've seen him before, somewhere. I think maybe in other line ups, but sir, I
don't reckon he's the killer." Bill's fist thudded on the table.  
"Look! This is the kid who killed your brother-in-law. We already know it is."  
  
He described to Juan the menacing thug they had arrested the other night,
emphasising that he'd shot a police officer. Juan looked shocked, but not
totally convinced that this made Ruben the shooter.  
"He killed your friend! He ain't nothing but a worthless thug!" Bill yelled.
Juan sat upright in his chair. "And he shot a cop! Do you think he has a
problem shooting some illegal Mexican?" Bill drew on his cigarette, before he
casually added, "Yeah that's right, we know you have no papers, so, if you
don't want to cooperate, then I'll give Immigration a call"  
Juan's heart palpitated in his mouth, his chest and stomach were iron-gripped
with anxiety. His head swelled with confusion and fear.  
"So what's the point of being deported? All you would be doing is protecting
the man who shot, ah, Pedro. We know it was him. Yesterday arvo a young guy
came forward and made a statement, said it was him."  
  
Juan began to wonder whether he could be wrong about the Cantu kid being the
murderer. It had been dark, and the pain horrific, traumatising. Maybe he had
been mistaken. Everyone seemed to think it was this Ruben, why didn't he?  
  
"But sir, I'm illegal. Won't they deport anyway me if I testify?"  
"Don't worry about that. I have a friend over at the Department, we'll have
that sorted in a couple of days. Now I just need you to sign this statement,"
Ewell pushed a document forward, "and we can go from there." Juan signed it.
Bill held his breath as the black ink marked the statement.  
"Gotcha," he whispered under his breath.

CANTU RESIDENCE  
SOUTH SAN ANTONIO  
MONDAY MARCH 4, 1985.  
  
Robert Cantu slammed the phone down, the plastic receiver almost shattering
through the table. It wasn't the call he had been expecting. For days he had
waited patiently for the call to come through, for the police to tell him that
Ruben was being released without charge. When the call finally came it
certainly wasn't the police.  
  
No. It was Ernesto Lopez telling him that Ramiro Reyes had ratted out Ruben
and made a statement fingering him for the Briggs St Murder.  
  
Robert shook with rage. Ramiro, the real murderer, had sold out the one man
willing to protect him.  
  
"Why are you telling me this?" He asked. But the line had gone dead.  
  
It didn't matter anyway. Robert knew exactly what he had to do.  
  
  
6:00pm  
OUTSIDE REYES RESIDENCE  
SUNDAY JULY 21, 1985.  
  
Robert had been sitting in his truck for hours, waiting for Ramiro to return
home. It was the eve of Ruben's trial and this was his last role of the dice.
A locked and loaded .44 Magnum lay eager across his lap, its shiny trigger
begging to be squeezed, to finally resolve the matter. The sun was beginning
to set and a gloomy twilight descended. The lack of either definitive darkness
or light was perfect.  
  
Robert knew that if he failed tonight it was over. The trial would start and
Ramiro would testify. The cheap state-appointed attorney, an alcoholic has-
been clinging to his law license, wasn't capable of mounting a defence against
a raging paperclip, let alone the gun legal team of the District Attorney's
finest.  
  
The District Attorney, Sam Millsap, an ambitious young man of thirty-
something, more politician than attorney, sought to make an example of Cantu.
For weeks newspapers had been running front page 'exclusives' depicting Ruben
as a 'ruthless murderer', 'police-killer', 'local drug pin' and 'budding mass
murdering psychopath'. Not one had bothered to examine the glaring holes in
the prosecution's case. Not one raised the possibility that the local police
were protecting one of their own, nor the coincidental timing of the arrest.
No, in the eyes of the press, Ruben was a murderer, plain and simple. Why
bother even having a trial? Ruben had already been tried by the media, and
convicted by the people.  
  
Ramiro's truck pulled up across the street. A Chino sat beside him, acting as
a bodyguard. Flicking off the safety Robert wound down the window. His black
balaclava blended into the darkness of the truck's interior. The handgun was
poised out of the driver's window. Robert's finger hugged the trigger. Steel
glinted in the encroaching night. Slowly his finger drew back.  
  
BAM! The shot rang out in the dusk air. BAM! Another followed. BAM! BAM! BAM!
BAM!  
  
Robert emptied the clip into Ramiro's car. The windows shattered and showered
shards of glass. Bullets thudded into the car and blasted through the
interior. Robert, his motor already running, stepped on the accelerator and
sped off into the darkening night.  
  
§§§§§§§  
  
The rain of bullets and symphony of twisted metal stopped, and the sound of a
speeding truck faded into the distance. Ramiro looked up. In the remaining
shard of the rear vision mirror he could see a red streak across his cheek.
With his hand he touched it and looked at his bloody finger tips. A bullet had
grazed his face. He looked across. The Chino had taken a shot to the right
side of his chest and blood soaked through his white shirt. It was serious,
but he wasn't going to die.  
  
  
11:00pm  
ELLIS UNIT DEATH ROW  
HUNTSVILLE, TEXAS.  
MONDAY AUGUST 23, 1993.  
  
  
A solemn figure sat in the prison cafeteria, surrounded only by empty chairs
and tables. On his plate was barbeque chicken, refried beans and brown rice.
His request for bubble gum had been denied. It was against prison regulations
so he settled for sweet tea. The room was dead silent, the only sound was the
faint chink of the plastic cutlery against the metal plate. Ruben Cantu was
enjoying his last meal. At 26 he would finally depart the cruel world that had
cruelly taken his life at 17.  
  
Over the past eight years Ruben had become a man. His arms were covered in
crude prison tattoos, simple designs of animals and spider webs, a
representation of his boredom rather than some symbolic higher meaning.  
  
As the minutes on the clock ticked down, Ruben continued to eat slowly
savouring the last bites of his final meal. There was a calm sense of
realisation, he had accepted the inevitability of his impending death. For
Ruben Cantu there would be no August 25. Not that it was so bad, one couldn't
lament the loss of life when it's sustaining elements had already been
extinguished.  
  
In the eight years he had spent on Death Row in the Ellis Unit he had not made
physical contact with his family or friends. The closest he came was the brief
moment at the end of each visit. Ruben and his visitor would both place a hand
upon the perspex; so close, yet so far away, together only in a plastic
embrace. Devastated, a single tear would leak from Ruben's eyes before the
guard would burst into the room and command that the session was finished.  
  
  
12:00am  
ELLIS UNIT DEATH ROW  
HUNTSVILLE, TEXAS.  
TUESDAY AUGUST 24, 1993.  
  
  
Ruben stared at the ceiling of the preparation room. Behind the next steel
door fate and a date with the executioner awaited him with open arms. Strapped
to a gurney he could only move his eyes. As he had finished his meal fifteen
minutes earlier and placed his plastic cutlery together on the plate six men
dressed in orange jumpsuits entered the cafeteria. Knowing his time was up
Ruben made no resistance. Together they walked down the convicted man's 'final
walk'; the passage leading from the cafeteria to the Execution Chamber
Preparation Room. The men in orange tied him to his death bed, and like
pallbearers they wheeled him into the Execution Room.  
  
The curtains opened to reveal two identical windows on opposite sides of the
room, the witnessing room for the family of the accused and the family of the
victim. Only a panes of perspex separated Ruben and the two groups. In the
victims' box Bill Ewell and Joe De La Luz were sitting together smirking with
cold vengeance. Beside them journalist Harold Williams smiled as he wrote
notes so he could vividly describe the execution to his viewers. Harold turned
to the two officers and congratulated them on their 'fine police work'.
Neither Juan Moreno nor his brother Eusebio were in attendance. Likewise,
there was nobody from the family of Pedro Gomez, the man Ruben was convicted
for murdering. Just the two police officers, a reporter and a bunch of pro-
capital punishment supporters carrying placards declaring Ruben's impending
execution as a victory for justice.  
  
Ruben crooked his head in the direction of his family. His mother was crying
and dabbed at her eyes with tissues. His sister sobbed uncontrollably. His
father and brother sat still, not a single tear formed between them yet their
eyes were stricken with a disbelieving fear. All their knuckles were white,
hands gripped tight on the arms of their chairs. Except for Robert's. His
knuckles were white too, but he was clutching a large steel crucifix that hung
from a chain around his neck. He made eye contact with Ruben, and his left
hand pressed against the perspex. They'd had eight years to prepare for this
day, but couldn't. A last minute reprieve would free him surely.  
  
Too late. A chamber attendant wearing a black mask injected the Sodium
Thiopental. Within seconds Ruben drifted into unconsciousness, his eyes
rolling back into his head. A second injection, this time of Pancuronium,
caused his muscles to relax and his entire body to enter paralysis. His
breathing ceased and his hands let go of the gurney. Finally the attendant
administered the Potassium Chloride and his heart abruptly stopped.  
  
Ruben felt his heart stop, its rhythmic pulses ceasing like a sand-clogged
engine. At first he tried to struggle, but his body didn't respond. A drowning
sensation, his own body was suffocating him. Slowly he felt the warmth of his
body recede. Starting in the fingers and toes, working its way up. In its
place was nothing, just cold emptiness. It reached his chest, and finally he
was submerged in its coldness. Darkness.  
  
Ruben Cantu was pronounced dead at 12:08am on Tuesday the 24th of August 1993.
Outside the prison gates a loud cheer broke out. The Pro-Death Penalty
Campaigners, most of whom had spent the evening outside the gates drinking,
chanting and displaying their banners, had secured another victory. A job well
done was celebrated by more drinks, the beeping of horns and back slaps all-
round before they all got in their cars and drove home.  
  
Ten minutes later, standing in the prison car park, Harold Williams looked up
from his notebook and turned to his cameraman.  
"Earl. You ready to roll?"  
"Right when you are Harry."  
  
Action.  
  
"I'm standing out the front of the Ellis Unit in Huntsville this evening where
only moments ago notorious gangster and murderer Ruben Cantu was executed by
lethal injection. Cantu was convicted in 1985 for slaying Pedro Gomez in cold
blood, shooting him eight times in a vicious home invasion.  
  
Sergeant Bill Ewell of the South San Antonio Police Department, the lead
investigator of the murder, commended the efforts of his team in arresting
Ruben Cantu. He especially paid tribute to Officer Joe De La Luz who, in March
1985, was shot by Cantu at a local bar whilst carrying out enquiries regarding
the murder. Luckily Officer De La Luz, an outstanding policeman, survived the
unprovoked attack. Ultimately it was this shooting that convinced members of
his gang, concerned with his psychotic behaviour , to turn him in to police.  
  
For the victims of Ruben Cantu's heinous crimes tonight the eight year wait
has finally come to an end. The journey has been difficult, fraught with the
pain and stress of appeals as well as Cantu's belligerent refusal to admit his
guilt, but they can now rest assured that justice has been served."  
  
And cut.  
"Come on. Screw standing round, let's go home."  
  
  
  
  
(THE END)  
  
  
  
  
In memory of the 152 people who were executed in Texas under Governor George W
Bush. Affectionately known as the 'Texacutioner', he signed the death warrants
of more prisoners than any other elected official in US history. He used his
powers of clemency only once.
