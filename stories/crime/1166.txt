The idyllic mid sized townhouse in Monona, Wisconsin, was the scene and
through the hallway into the living room, a mother and daughter are laying on
the sofa. The television was playing cartoons. The air was still and the pair
on the sofa were cold and still.  
  
"I need to see them!" The lawyer quoted from the deceased's statement. The
witness stand was occupied by a doctor, middle aged and balding. His cheeks
pulsating wildly as he looked back to the lawyer, as if he was practicing his
answer to the question that would surly be his first in the stand. He looked
up from the sheet on his desk, towards the witness box. "Is this not what you
heard from Jacob Michael? Can you tell the court in your eyes, how Jacob
Michael acted after the police left him in your custody overnight?  
The doctor replied 'yes' to the first question and to answer the second, he
detailed how he had witnessed the accused comply with the authorities; how
he'd break down afterwards, how he had walked in the house and found them in
the living room.  
During his time in the room in Shaded Palms psychiatric facility, Jacob had
asked the doctor 'how could someone kill my wife and my little girl'.  
The doctor hadn't got an answer to comfort him with.  
  
"Please doctor, can you tell me what he had said in these conversations?"  
"Yes, but anytime a member of staff goes into a patient's room, a recorder in
the wall records any sound made by the room's occupants. I believe the tapes
have all that was said on them".  
"I understand that, but can you tell me what he told your staff?"  
"He told my staff that he found his wife and his daughter in the living room".  
"Did he say if they were alive?"  
"He said, 'he walked into the house and called to his wife to let her know he
was home', he said 'he moved though the hallway into the living room. His
daughter lay still in her mothers' arms on the sofa. There was blood every
where. They were dead'".  
"What did he say after that?"  
"Well at that point he broke into tears. That conversation was ended there".  
"Thank you Dr Grayson". The lawyer directed himself toward the judge. "No more
questions your honour".  
  
The court was quiet as the lawyer began his closing statement. He appealed to
the jury that the defendant was innocent.  
He closed the speech with a few words. "Someone killed Jacob's wife of fifteen
years and his five year old daughter. I know their last breath taken wasn't
taken with unadulterated fear as he watched. Jacob Michael is innocent  
  
The silent courtroom was now filled with hushed whispers which rose to
muttering and exchanges of reactions between the public galleries. The judge
brought down his gavel and hushed the room. The judge ordered the court retire
for the jury to reach a verdict.  
  
The courtroom rose as the judge entered. Once seated, he turned his attention
toward the jury and asked the spokesman, "Have you reached a verdict in which
you all agree?"  
"Yes" replied the juror.  
"How do you find the accused, guilty or not guilty?"  
"Not guilty".  
The courts occupants began to talk and members of the press began phoning
their respective newsrooms.  
The judge ordered silence, told the users of the mobile phones to end their
calls and proceeded to close the trial.  
  
"Today this court and a jury of his piers have found Jacob Michael Not guilty
on two counts of first degree murder. The state of Wisconsin has great cause
to apologise to the family of Jacob Michael." The judge paused. He looked
around the room slowly, through the bifocals on the tip of his nose. He
Continued, "I hope that the Michaels family can understand that in his
previous trial neither the state or the Michaels lawyer did not have the
conversation tapes we do today. I don't think any amount of words will make
this mistake easier for Mr Michaels' family, but I do hope one day this
verdict will bring a little comfort. No-one can ever be certain that any
person sentenced to death and that sentence carried out, maybe innocent. We
can only pray that such mistakes will not happen again". The judge announced
to the court that the case was closed. The judge stood and left the courtroom.
His head bowed.
