Chapter Four

"Alright, maybe I lied about before." The young man with wavy brown hair said  
"You shouldn't have, you do understand what you have done by lying?" Hector
said.  
The young man nodded and bit his lip, afraid of the consequences of his
foolish actions.  
"That child is dangerous, and we have to get him, you seen him, and, not only
did you not attempt to capture him, you lied about even seeing him," Hector
sighed and ran a finger through his greasy, now greying hair. "He’s extremely
dangerous."  
"You think I don't know that?" The young man said; opening his arms as if to
make out Hector was a profound idiot, Hectors face cringed as if he had just
taken offence to the gesture. "He’s just found another victim to play with,
and I'm scared to go anywhere back near him, just in case his attentions draw
back to me."  
  
Hector walked to his desk, opening the side draw he pulled out a small bottle
of whiskey and two tumbler glasses, pouring a generous amount in each glass,
he handed one to the young man, and kept one for himself, indulging himself on
the whiskey in a five second silence where he generously nearly downed most of
the whiskey itself.

"Ah," Hector smiled, "I need that."  
The young man give a weak smile, and looked down at the weak brown liquid
juggling itself in the tumbler glass due to his motions. "I think there’s more
to that kid than it seems who has heard of a killer kid who seems to have
supernatural powers that kills doctors and god knows how many other people."  
  
Hector topped his whiskey glass up, taking another generous gulp. He sighed
and looked down at the ground, hoping the young man was ready for what he was
about to be told.  
  
"This kid has killed doctors, nurses, surgeons, Neurologist, even fucking
intensivists, but-"  
The young man cut Hector of, "What’s an intensivist?"  
Hector sighed. "A doctor who specialises in intensive care, its uncommon here,
other countries, though, practice it regularly. More to the point, the
doctors’, nurses, and so forth that have died recently, well, murdered
recently all have the same pattern, a birthday card is always left in the room
where the bodies lay, this has been happening for two years now, last year the
birthday card was for a nine year old, now it’s for a ten year old, what’s
more disturbing is that something belonging to a child is always left, a
packet of crayons, a stuffed teddy bear, you get the picture."  
  
"The psychology points toward the kid maybe showing the victims, and the
people around them of a stolen childhood?"  
"I don't know, you’re the psychologist, and how the hell you're one at your
age, I don’t know, fair fucks to you nevertheless." Hector downed the whiskey,
placing the tumbler glass hard on the desk, clearly frustrated.  
The young man walked towards him, smiling. "Look, we know the police won't be
able to catch this kid, like c'mon, it’s a kid, they won't think a child is
capable of that much murders, without been caught, like what kid have you ever
known that knows about not leaving fingerprints, semen for DNA analysis."  
Hectors face drained colour. "Semen?"  
  
The young man sighed. "Post-mortem carried shows that two of the nurses were
raped."  
"How the fuck is that possible? Can ten year old kids even get a fucking
stiffy?"  
"I know....it just isn't adding up, latest victim is a doctor Adam Griff,
family doctor, woman named emm..." He stopped to think for a brief second, and
snapped his fingers in delight. "Angela Maton, apparently she’s been stalked
by the kid, been watching her, she’s in a motel at the minute, I set up a
sneak camera when she was asleep, the wonders of motels doors, yeah? Fucking
things are weak as water."  
"You think he has an obsession this Angela?"  
"I wouldn’t know, but it’s a break in the pattern, nurses, doctors, and now a
woman who’s just out of an abusive relationship, all alone?"  
"He doesn’t seem like the type of killer that attacks lone woman with no
connection to anything remotely medical."  
The young man raised his hand, ready to share his opinion.  
"Well, maybe it’s an obsession, serial killers always work on their own, and
let’s face it, no matter how fucked in the head they are, they are human,
still have the same emotions and needs, companionship, they feel loneliness,
wanting to share their progress and achievements with everybody. This kid
communicated with Angela through the writing on the wall, and in her motel
room, he’s looking for a partner to share his success."  
Hector looked down at the floor; again, he knew this was bad, very bad.  
"Wait," Hector started breathing heavy. "The pattern was also broken again."  
The young man looked with frustration. "Crap, how?"  
"Adam Griff, dead, no birthday card, no stuffed toy, crayons, you know."  
"That is weird..."  
Hector nodded. "And it also makes our job a lot fucking harder."  
"I'm getting paid, you're not. Let’s find this kid."  
Hector started pacing around the room for a few seconds, the young man
confused by him not speaking.  
"No, Leon, let’s find Angela Maton."

Doctor Joshua Harnett felt especially good today, he has finally asked out
that girl he liked, and he was looking forward to returning home after a long
days work and relaxing on the couch.  
He drove home, watching the night traffic fly past him in motions, the lights
of the city looking so beautiful and the young people out clubbing and
pubbing, ah he had to go out sometime, blow of some steam.  
He parked his car outside his small two bedroom bungalow, it had to do until
he had enough to get a mortgage for a decent place, nevertheless, it felt like
home to him, and when he moved out, he knew a small piece of him would yearn
for it back, but no matter, he though, sometimes you have to move on, whether
it’s over the smallest, stupidest things.  
Retrieving the key from his coat pocket, he opened the door and stepped
inside, he fumbled about and looked for the light switch, when he did, he
froze.  
  
On the wall, in red writing, was a sentence.  
  
"DO YOU KNOW THAT OVER 195,000 PEOPLE DIE IN HOSPITALS EACH YEAR? IN THIS
COUNTRY ALONE."  
  
Joshua was scared, somebody was here, he could feel the evil presence, lurking
somewhere.  
"Hello?" He called out, but smacked himself for doing it; he felt stupid if
they're was somebody potentially dangerous here.  
He walked into the kitchen, flicking on the light switch, another message:  
  
"Mammy did not know what was blooming, in the end her despair was glooming, so
when the first bullet pierced my chest, it aspired to me, that this was a
test."  
Joshua’s heart was beating in his chest almost like he would have a heart
attack, pure fear and panic was what he was feeling now, when he went to run
out the front door, the first message was gone, almost like it had never been
there, replaced by a new message:  
  
"Run little rabbit, run, see how far you get."  
  
He ignored it as best he could, he ran for the front door, nearly
there...nearly there, then bam, he was knocked unconscious.  
The young boy looked down at his latest victim, smiling.  
He crouched down, rolling the body over so he could see Joshua’s face; he
smiled again and whispered into his ear, "Let's see if you pass my test."
