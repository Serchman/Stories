**RECON + COMMANDO = RECONDO**

Reconnaissance commandos or Recondos were highly trained asymmetric warfare
specialists utilized by the US military apparatus in Vietnam. Separate from
the Army Rangers and Green Berets, Recondos were specifically trained for long
range reconnaissance patrols behind enemy lines in jungle environments.
Training was rigorous with over half of aspirants failing the Recondo course.
Eventually more than 3,000 Recondos were trained. On their jungle patrols
Recondos would recon, ambush, and call fire support down on unsuspecting
enemies. The program was highly successful, at times achieving 400-to-1 kill
to death ratios against the enemy and overall accounting for 10,000 enemy KIA
throughout the war. All told, Recondos conducted some 23,000 long range
patrols, of which over 2/3 made contact with the enemy. The program was
discontinued in 1970 by General Creighton Abrams, who favored a more
conventional approach to war effort. The following stories detail the post-war
exploits of one of these highly effective jungle fighters.

**New York, 1974:** A suicidal teenager armed with a bolt-action .30-06-caliber rifle infiltrates his high school during winter break. He kills an unsuspecting janitor with a single shot to head, sets the school ablaze, and then barricades himself in a third floor conference room. He begins shooting random passersby from a window. A dozen bystanders are wounded by gunfire. A firefighter responding to the fire alarm is killed by a stray shot to the heart. A middle-aged employee eating lunch on a bench in front of his employer’s building is also killed, shot through the head. Local police soon surround and tear gas the building, while National Guardsmen retrieve wounded bystanders with an armored car. A former Army Recondo, who was in the area, taking a walk while having a cigarette, trying to chase away some post-war ghosts, is among those caught in the crossfire. He retrieves a wounded victim from the line of fire, then reunites with some of his former squad-mates who are now National Guardsmen. Trusting his uncanny instinct and Vietnam proven combat ability, they give him a rifle. The former Recondo, some Guardsmen, and some police officers enter the school. They take fire from the teenage gunman in a third floor hallway and become pinned down and disoriented in a cloud of tear gas. The former Recondo advances despite this, crawling along on his stomach, he engages the teenage gunman in firefight, and wounds him three times with 5.56mm rifle shots. The madness ends, the shooter is taken into custody by the accompanying police officers, and the remaining wounded on the street are evacuated. As he sits on the sidewalk, finishing his cigarette, the former Recondo considers joining the military again, missing the rush of combat. Though he decides against it later that night as there are no wars the US is involved in and the Recondo program hasn’t been revived. The wounded teenage gunman, recovers from his wounds, but commits suicide by hanging in his jail cell a few months later.

**Guyana, 1978:** The former Recondo, now a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent assigned to investigate the People’s Temple religious group, is tasked by his superiors to assume the role of a detecting People’s Temple member for Congressman Leo Ryan’s upcoming visit and use the role as an excuse for extraction back to the US. He had spent the previous months gathering intelligence on the group and living amongst them like a normal member. He always kept himself armed though, carrying a secret concealed weapon (a Ruger Standard .22-caliber pistol) unbeknownst to the Jonestown colonists. The mission was strictly intelligence gathering in aim and was successful, the Bureau would have all the information they ever wanted on the group once he got back to headquarters and filed his report. However, as he walked beside Congressman Ryan to their flight out of the country, he senses an ambush coming on, just like he used to on long range reconnaissance patrols in Vietnam. He runs his fingers over the Ruger Standard .22-caliber pistol concealed beneath his shirt, he stops in his tracks and slowly turns around. A tractor pulling a hay cart drives up the edge of the runway, its passengers (People’s Temple members) immediately open fire with several shotguns and semiautomatic rifles. The opening salvo wounds Congressman Ryan, several members of his delegation, a few Jonestown defectors, and the former Recondo. The former Recondo shields Congressman Ryan, pulls out his pistol, and returns fire, killing a cultist charging towards the plane firing a shotgun with several shots to the chest. The former Recondo hides Congressman Ryan behind the mid-fuselage landing gear of the plane. A Jonestown defector and a member of Congressman Ryan’s delegation are killed by multiple shots in the continuing fusillade of fire from the attacking cultists. The former Recondo reloads and advances on the cultists still firing full tilt from the hay tractor. He hides behind the forward landing gear and burns through his final clip of ammunition. By sheer skill and luck one of his shots hits a cultist just above the right eye, killing him instantly, causing him to fall forward off the hay tractor, his hand still clinging to his rifle in death. A startled cultist trips up trying to jump off the hay cart and accidentally discharges his shotgun, striking himself in the chest, causing his death shortly there afterward. The cultists, demoralized by the deaths of their comrades, fire a few more scattering shots and then hastily drive off. The former Recondo rushes forward and picks up a shotgun off the first cultist he downed. Returning to the plane he can see it was savaged by gunfire during the shootout. They’re stranded. The plane is inoperable. The former Recondo and those not wounded in the shooting triage the victims and set up a defensive position in the jungle on the edge of the runway. The former Recondo stands guard as the survivors huddle together and care for the wounded throughout the rest of the day and all of the night. Assistance finally reaches them after 18 hours; the former Recondo never rests or relents from his watch. On the flight back to the states, the survivors learn that the attacking cultists returned to their colony where they committed ritualistic suicide along with over 900 others of their group, including their leader. The former Recondo is lauded for saving the Congressman and driving off the cultist attack. However he demands he be privately lauded and the event kept out of the media. After a ceremony and a short res leave, he returns to active duty as a field agent.

Future installments:

**Miami, 1986:** The former Recondo and his fellow FBI agents engage a pair of serial killer bank robbers in a wild shootout in a church parking lot.

**Waco, 1993:** Attached to the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) agency, the former Recondo again finds himself battling cultists when a surprise raid on their heavily armed compound goes haywire.
