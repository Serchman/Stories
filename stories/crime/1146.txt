Beckett stood on the canalside, watching his breath drift in the winter air.
His new gloves were tight and stiff and he kept flexing his fingers in an
effort to wear them in, anxiety over-animating these seemingly innocent
motions.  
He pitied the poor sods that had to search the bottom of the canal in this
weather. They'd had to break the ice on the surface before they could dive.
The thought alone made him shiver, that and the prospect of what they might
find entombed down there in the mud and slime.  
At least he didn't have to go crawling around amongst the bushes and ditches.
Rank hath its privileges, he mused.  
"Inspector?" A voice behind him enquired.  
Beckett turned to the fresh-faced constable, "Yes, lad?"  
"They. . " He swallowed hard. "They've found her, sir."  
Beckett felt acid work in his gut. Soon he would get a cynic's ulcer, of that
he was certain.  
"The canal?" he asked.  
"No, sir, she's. . ."  
He noticed how the young copper's voice faltered for an instant. The kid's
skin was pale and his lips were set in a thin line. And Beckett wondered
whether those were tears in the lad's eyes or just winter's sting.  
"Deep breath, son," said Beckett.  
The cop nodded and took a long steadying breath. He gestured over his left
shoulder, "She's over there." Obviously loath to lead the way.  
Beckett said, "Okay, lad. There's a flask of coffee in my car. Help yourself.
Only a little, mind, it's strong stuff, understand?" The copper mumbled
embarrassed thanks. Beckett instinctively searched his pockets for the
cigarettes that he had given up two months before. "Shit," he said, and went
to look at the girl's corpse.  
Katrina Keates' body lay naked, hidden behind a copse of bushes just a few
feet from the towpath, covered by a thin sheet. Her hands were still bound
behind her back and her lips bared in a dead grin. Her hair was long and very
blonde and the winter sun, having dried it, now gave it cruel life; blue eyes,
dull as marbles now, held memories of laughter and vitality like echoes in a
shallow bay.  
Beckett hoped that the rookie kid wasn't going to drink all his coffee. He'd
need some himself.  
The killer had given them a five mile stretch of the canal to search, and he
was, as usual, as good as his word. He never let the bodies linger, but he
never led the cops straight to them.  
He liked them to dig a little.  
Stooping by the body was a man in his late twenties with wispy receding blond
hair. He was immaculate in his navy blue mac with matching tie. Beckett
couldn't help but think that the very act of dressing up to look for a corpse
was somehow obscene, but then DC Armstrong was newly promoted and eager to
make a good impression. Beckett hunkered down beside Armstrong as the young DC
pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and placing it over his nose, leaned
over the corpse, twisting the head one way then the other. He noticed Beckett
watching him and said: "She's been dead for ten, maybe twelve hours, sir.
Death induced by a single incision to the base of the skull with a pointed
instrument."  
"You're a DC, Armstrong, not a coroner," Beckett reminded him, "I hardly think
you're qualified to make that judgement."  
Armstrong eased back from the body. He removed the handkerchief from his face
and drew a deep long frosty breath through his nose, ridding his nostrils of
the stench of death. "Yes, sir, but I consider seeing five others just like
this one is qualification enough."  
Beckett had to concede the point. There had been five dead girls in as many
months, all the same, no copycats, not yet. One single well-placed incision at
the base of the skull with a sharp steel object, but not a knife. The
investigation team had exhausted every possible connection between the five
homicide victims. They all had long blonde hair and only one more detail
consistent with each murder. Beckett took the pair of tweezers out of the end
of his Swiss Army knife and handed them to Armstrong.  
"Jesus," Armstrong exclaimed softly, "Not me again."  
"Well, Dr Armstrong," Beckett teased. "You seem to be on a roll. I would hate
to spoil it for you."  
Armstrong took a deep breath and gently reached for the edge of the sheet,
drawing it up slowly.  
"Don't be so bashful," Beckett said. "I hardly think she's going to slap your
face."  
Armstrong winced and lifted the sheet high enough to reveal her bare hips. He
delicately retrieved the killer's 'calling card' from between her legs and
quickly covered her again. Even the dead deserve their dignity. He handed it
to Beckett, the latter turning it in the grip of the tweezers. It was the same
as all the rest, a tiny origami dove. He dropped it into his gloved palm,
regarding it with the hopeless wish that it would spread its wings and lead
him to its creator.  
The popular press had christened the murderer: 'The Origami Killer.' Beckett
had fought desperately to keep it quiet, to weed out the bogus callers that
were now jamming the switchboard back at the station.  
A voice behind him interrupted his thoughts, "They've still got nothing to
say."  
Beckett looked up at the plainclothes sergeant standing beside him and said,
"Ah, Jones." He went back to studying the folded bird to which the sergeant
referred. "No, still nothing to say." And then his forehead creased in a
moment's realisation and a faint tingle of anticipation ran up his spine.
"Nothing to say," he repeated quietly while removing his gloves with his
teeth. When his hands were bare he very carefully unfolded the paper dove,
smoothing out the creases until he had in his hands a small square, three
sides cut perfectly, each at 90Â°, but one side a fold-and-tear. The piece of
paper had started life the wrong shape for the killer's origami, but Beckett
could almost feel the killer's compulsive inability to leave the body without
one of his little paper sculptures to mark his passing, and he knew right then
that it was all he had had on him when he had left Katrina here.  
He showed it to Armstrong, who frowned and said, "Maybe he just picked it up.
Maybe it was just litter."  
"Maybe," said Beckett unconvinced.  
"God, but if it's not..."  
"If it's not..." and Beckett spread his palms in a gesture of hopeful
expectation.

Jonathan Cane had already spent over seventy pounds on newspapers alone in the
past five months and he mentally avoided estimating his expenditure on the
Polaroid camera and films. It had been worth it though, undoubtedly, but he
had reached the age of thirty without ever spending money on anything but bus
fare, a few clothes, and the board he gave his mother, and so such apparently
spendthrift habits left him feeling vaguely uneasy. He couldn't bare the
thought that it might suddenly become the norm in all areas of his life.  
But this was his art, his molten polaroids of the dead girls. He had first
seen the technique used by Ralph Steadman in a Sunday magazine. It was easy.
You just took the fresh polaroid and warmed it under your arm and then you
could smear the colours and form of the photograph to create new and alien
images. But he didn't do that with all the polaroids. Sometimes he would pose
his 'models'. They were only too eager to please him, supple as gymnasts, no
pose too difficult, no part of their anatomy denied him. Where the top shelf
suppliers feared to tread, Cane's blades opened and revealed, going beyond
nudity, finding truth in heat and liquid and coils.  
He knew that he was bestowing upon them a kind of immortality. They would
always be his victims. In fifty years time in some sordid paperback anthology
of murders and murderers they would all be there; and so there was a certain
paradoxical price to be paid for his gift.  
___ * ___  
It was Monday. He got off work at nine. Dark had descended five hours earlier
and there was no moon tonight to betray him. The urge burned deep, creating a
tension headache that demanded the release of incisions, insertions. It had
been a month since the last one. What had her name been? Katrina. She had
produced the best picture yet. The wonderful flow of blonde hair like
quicksilver smeared across the photograph. Dark hair would lose the subtle
shades of light that only blonde hair could capture. He didn't need to kill a
dark haired girl to know that.  
When he boarded the bus there were only three others on; a big guy towards the
back in a leather jacket, a youth in denims further back, and, at the front, a
young woman with long blonde hair reading a Jackie Collins paperback. He felt
his heart press against his ribs urgently. The light from the sodium street
lamps made her hair seem like gold. She was perfect, the best yet. She looked
up at him from behind the pages of her book as he paid his fare, and he hated
her uninterested glance, just like the others. Didn't she know who he was?
What he had done? What he could still do any time he wanted? He was the one
they would never catch. He recalled the newspaper clipping he had saved;
Police baffled. D.I Beckett was the man in charge of the investigation, Cane
had read with interest, the best they had. Well their best fell a long way
short. They were no match for the Origami Killer. He liked the name the papers
had given him. He liked the secret power, he fed on the words that he had fed
to them, the tabloids his unwitting symbiotic hosts. He grew stronger. Strong
enough for it to be seen. And those beautiful girls that had spurned him had
seen it. And soon this one would see it too.  
Cane sat two seats behind her on the opposite side. He could feel the
reassuring shape of the wooden handled spike through the thin lining of his
ruck sack. He carried it everywhere with him, it was his talisman, his good
luck charm, the tool of his trade. He had made it himself at home. It was a
good tool, sharp and thin. He was especially pleased with the handle. He had
stained the wood black to hide the blood stains. It was contoured perfectly
for his grip. He was good at his art. One day they would call him a genius for
it.  
He liked them to see it once before using it, watching their indifference of
him turn to fear, and then from fear to respect. The mute respect of death.  
He didn't like there to be much blood or violence. The pleasure was in feeling
the soul exit the body, feeling the life receding from the touch of his free
hand. The sight of too much blood would have made him feel sick and ruined the
picture. There was a skill in using a spike. He was an artist not a butcher.
He had very little regard for the killers who had come before him. Where was
their subtlety? Where even craftsmanship? Where was the art?  
The street lights diminished in number and intensity as the bus left the town
behind and slipped through dimly lit suburbs. Darkness pressed in heavily
against the windows producing a perfect mirror image of its occupants, the
effect enabling Cane to watch her closely while pretending to look through the
window and at the featureless landscape.  
She remained intent upon her open book, occasionally glancing up to check
where she was. Then she closed her book and looked up, expectantly placing one
hand on the back of the seat in front. Cane, recognising the familiar motion,
was out of his seat and moving towards the exit doors. He had anticipated well
and was thrilled to see her also getting up. It was a tried and tested routine
to allay any possible suspicion. After all, who could suspect him if he left
the bus first?  
When Cane got off she followed behind him a little way. He crossed over the
road, watching her in the reflections of the shop windows. She didn't look
across at him. They both walked the same way for several blocks, until the
shops began to thin out, giving way to warehouses looming darkly in the quiet
of a small industrial complex. He listened to her footsteps recede as she
turned a corner and he continued on a few more paces before glancing idly over
his shoulder. She was gone. He began to retrace her steps, slipping quietly
across the complex road, looking round the side of one of the warehouses. She
was there, walking slowly away down an alley, almost strolling, as though she
had nothing to fear from the lurking shadows. He looked furtively around, they
were alone. He could surprise her as she came out the other side.  
This would be his second purely opportunist killing. And he was unbelievably
excited by the prospect. After this he would break the pattern, leave Beckett
one of his more elaborate origamis, perhaps the foil scorpion he had been
working on. He liked the idea of tempting them with obscure and useless clues
-Scorpio was his birth sign. He almost felt like he could do anything, so
pronounced was his sense of the inconceivability of capture. Even as he
wrapped his hand around the blackened handle of his weapon he was smiling
inwardly at his ingenuity. The luxury of conceit was his to take.  
Cane skirted around the complex stopping at the other end of the alley by the
edge of the warehouses. He took a quick note of his surroundings, the new
office block three quarters finished, token trees planted by a pointlessly
winding path, the lines of skips at the back of the complex -the latter would
prove a suitable burial ground in the circumstances. He positioned himself on,
what would be, her left side as she emerged. Generally women were weak, more
so on their left sides. He waited, listening as the hollow click of her heels
grew louder. He tensed himself, feeling his adrenalin sending surges of
excitement through his groin. A moment later she stepped from the alley.  
Cane lunged at her, wrapping one arm around her throat, choking off her
startled cry of alarm. He brought the spike up towards the back of her neck.
Then just as he was revelling in the total surprise of his attack, his world
turned upside down as he was flipped over her shoulder, his feet flapping
uselessly in the air. But he had time to reflect on his misfortune. He
realised, too late, that this blonde was more than capable of protecting
herself. She had performed some kind of judo throw on him. He decided, when he
hit the ground, to take off, get away, forget this one and go back to his
original plan. But the blonde didn't allow for Cane's plans. Instead of just
letting him to fall to the ground, she drove him into it with surprising
strength and agility. He hit the ground painfully hard, banging his hip and
his shoulder against the unyielding concrete. Agony lanced down his leg and
across his chest, forcing the air from his lungs. Before he could recover from
the throw she was on him, twisting him savagely onto his front, his arms
behind his back, his face pushed into the gravel, grit digging into his skin
as she snapped the handcuffs on him.  
Then others appeared, shining torches, speaking in excited tones. He was numb
with fright as one of them turned him over. Cane recognised him as the man in
the leather jacket who had been sitting on the back of the bus. He informed
Cane that they were arresting him on suspicion of murder. They took away his
beautiful weapon, and emptied his bag out, taking the camera and his
photographs.  
Finally when the fuss had died down, Cane, still prostrate, got the chance to
meet his nemesis, the man who he had taunted. Beckett stood over him, saying
nothing.  
Cane was the first to break the silence. "How... how did you know?"  
Beckett took a folded bird out of his pocket. Cane recognised it immediately
as the one he had used on the body of the Keates woman. Beckett unfolded it
with a methodical delight and showed it to him. Cane silently cursed himself
for being so stupid - suddenly he was tiny again, no longer important,
unworthy of respect, a nobody.  
And Beckett smiled triumphantly and said. "Yes, that's right," and flicked the
creased bus ticket into the air. "A little bird told me."
