**** Intro:** Private Eyes, Criminals, Cards and Casual sex 

* * *

From time to time when I wasn't playing cards or in a bar, I occasionally did
my job. I had the hardship of being a private eye. Dark, cold alleyways and
stinking, cramped cellars were my workplace. Fraudsters, cheats, liars,
thieves and wife beaters were my employment apparatus. The hours were long,
the pay was low, the conditions were bad, the work was frequently
confrontational but I couldn't ever see myself doing anything else. I loved
every minute of it. Well, nearly every minute. I didn't enjoy the next few
minutes I'm about to tell you about.  
I think it was the light rain spraying my face that helped me to regain
consciousness. It wasn't a good time and if you could see me then you'd
probably have walked straight by without giving me a second glance. I lay on
my left side moaning and clutching the ribs on my right side. It felt like
Hellraisers' head was spinning around in my guts. At least the rain was
helping to wash the crusted blood off the wounds somewhere on my face. My
clothes were soaked through and in the darkness I felt the cold concrete
sidewalk slabs beneath me.  
My head pounded and my side felt sore as hell as I rolled onto my back and sat
up to get my bearings. Coughing and wheezing I hauled myself to my feet. I
stumbled backwards and fell over a metal trash can that clanged into a high
brick wall. Dead leaves from the trash can spilled over my legs and stomach. I
swore, dragged myself up the wall and attempted to brush myself down. I leant
with my back to the bricks gasping hoarsely. I needed a cigarette and a
scotch. Rummaging around in my coat pocket I found my pack of smokes. They
weren't so wet that I couldn't light one. The scotch would have to wait.  
I winced in pain as I breathed in the smoke; the first puff made me splutter
and gag. I massaged my aching jaw as my mind slowly recovered and I tried to
make sense of what the hell I'd been through tonight. I was slumped in a dimly
lit alleyway on a dark Thursday October night in East Village, Manhattan, New
York City. I know it sounds strange but the last thing I remember was playing
cards with a bunch of transvestites. I swore out loud, I hoped I hadn't made a
play for one of them. No, I wasn't that drunk. Had one of them made a pass at
me? I'd refused so they decided to beat the crap out of me, was that it? No, I
definitely would have remembered that. Did they discover I was a private eye,
had my cover been blown? No, I remembered what it was. They caught me red
handed, cheating at cards. Oh well, once a cheat always a cheat is my motto.  
I lit my lighter again to check the time on my watch, 0220am. Time for that
scotch.  
From what I remembered I was a couple of blocks west of Tompkins Square Park,
which wasn't an ideal location after dark. I was quite a way from home which
happened to be Vinegar Hill in Brooklyn.  
The left side of my face was swelling up, I needed some alcoholic anesthetic.
I shivered and stumbled out of the alleyway into the dim, deserted street.
Swathes of light rain blustered past the faint orange glow of the street
lights. A lone car slowly splashed by, it's single occupant an elderly black
man wearing a trilby hat, nodding his head to the rhythm of blues music
twanging from the stereo. He didn't notice me as I staggered along the street
holding my right side. I fished around the inside pocket of my overcoat and
checked my wallet was still there. I found it and opened it. A few twenties
and tens were still inside. The transvestites hadn't robbed me at least. I
checked the other pocket for my digital camera. Luckily it was still there and
intact. That small piece of technology was worth its weight in gold. It held
incriminating evidence which made the beating worth a pay day.  
I found a small bar on Second Avenue with the neon signs in the window still
lit. I tried the door, it was unlocked. I pushed the door and was hit by the
noise of some stadium rock band whose name I couldn't remember. I'm not sure
if it's something to do with the job but every time I go into a place I always
look for numbers of bodies, either friendly or hostile. I look for possible
exits and I look for people looking at me.  
This bar was pretty empty. Not surprising at this time of night. The place had
an out of date 80's décor feel to it. Not retro, just out of date. The light
was too bright where it was lit and too dark where it wasn't. The whole place
had a kind of giddy feeling, or maybe that was me. A couple of late night
regular working guys in checked shirts and baseball caps played pool to the
right. Another young couple sat in a booth drinking wine and staring deeply
into each others eyes. They were obviously in the first throws of love and
probably hoping the night would go on forever.  
As I moved closer to the bar, a woman with short cropped blonde hair, maybe
mid twenties, sat cross legged on a stool. She looked me up and down and
sipped a beer. I noticed a slight smirk on her face. I nodded and followed
suit and looked her up and down. She wore a short sequined blue skirt and a
white low cut top. I double checked to see if she was one of the
transvestites. No, she was definitely all female. On another night I might
have tried my luck with her but tonight I looked like crap, ached like a
bastard and was soaked to the bone. The bartender approached with a worried
look on his face. He was an overweight guy with graying slicked hair, probably
in his mid fifties.  
"Rough night, Buddy?" he called out with some trepidation. His eyes flicked to
the door and back to me. I knew what he was thinking. Was I being followed and
would I cause any trouble? Bartenders were like private eyes, always weighing
up the situation. A guy walks in to the bar covered in the claret stuff equals
a potential problem. Simple math.  
"Got jumped by a couple of hoodies a few blocks back," I muttered. Modesty
prevented me from mentioning anything about transvestites.  
"There's a bathroom out back if you want to clean yourself up," he gestured
with his head behind the pool players. I knew he was still wary.  
"Can I get a drink first?" I asked with throat that felt like I'd been
gargling tacks.  
"Sure," the bartender nodded. "Just try not to drip blood on the floor. I've
just had it polished."  
I looked down at the chipped wooden floor that some third rate maintenance guy
had emptied a gallon of floor polish on without cleaning first. The bartender
had dumped a half dozen paper towels on the bar, obviously for my convenience.  
"Give me a bottle of beer and a scotch no ice," I barked. I was beginning to
get a little pissed with the fat bartender's attitude. I looked at Blondie to
my right and gestured. "Can I get you one?" A voice in my head said "what the
hell are you doing?"  
"I'll have the same," she smiled. "Thank you, handsome."  
My mood mellowed as I smiled back. Blondie had friendly, attractive blue eyes
that held the moment perfectly. I took a bunch of paper towels, wiped my face
and neck and was horrified at how much blood I'd mopped away. Normally, in the
presence of an attractive woman, I'd go and check myself in the mirror if I
thought there was something wrong with my appearance. Tonight, the way things
were, I couldn't give a shit. I needed a strong drink.  
"I'm Stacy," Blondie smiled holding out a welcoming hand.  
"I'm Max," I replied, returning a weak handshake and trying to give her my
best sexy look in my best Brooklyn accent. "Max Speed, Private Eye." I loved
saying that.  
As she shook my hand she gave a little sigh and I knew she was impressed. I
was born Michael Maxwell Speed but soon saw the advantage in having a cool
name. I used it in several ways over the years. Example: how I drove a car/
how I made love/ how I drank beer/ how I played football/ how I ran, or any
cliché I could think of.  
"Unfortunately, I work here as my second job," Stacy sighed. "If you want to
live in Manhattan you have to work at least two jobs." She waved her hand in a
dismissive way and picked up a packet of cigarettes. "I do a day job in the
clothes store two doors down and work here evenings." She offered me a
cigarette and I gratefully took it.  
The bartender returned with our drinks. I took a couple of sips of beer and
necked back the scotch in one gulp. I noticed Stacy did the same. She smiled
although she gagged when the scotch fired up its burn in her chest. Clearly,
she was trying to latch onto somebody. If she had a boyfriend they'd be
snuggled up by now doing what 20 something's do at 0230 in the morning.  
I crushed out the cigarette into her ashtray and headed for the bathroom. I
had to start thinking straight. The pool guys gave me a cautious glance as I
passed them. The bathroom had whitewashed walls and ceiling with black and
white tiled floor. The bright white decor felt overwhelming and the reek of
shit and vomit seemed to be an adequate compliment to the furnishings. I
thought fat man's floor cleaners had probably been in here doing just as
shoddy job as the wooden floors in the bar.  
I looked at my reflection in the mirror. My nose was flattened and bloody, my
left eye was puffed and purple, my lips were bleeding and swollen. Blood
dripped from a cut in my forehead. "Maxey Boy, you look like shit," I said to
myself.  
I fanned a hand through my blood and rain soaked hair. Although I just turned
forty I thought I could still cut the mustard. Nature blessed me with the
looks of a dark haired James Dean even though I'd lived through more dawn
choruses than a blackbird, more bottles of scotch than Jim Morrison and more
scrapes than Batman, Robin, Spiderman and Superman put together.  
First thing to do was check the digital camera. The case was a wife suspecting
her husband of being, well slightly different. The pictures were there. A
certain Mr. Mark Charlton, a respectable city worker, going into a house in
East Village for a game of cards. He came out as Franny the Tranny the card
dealer. I'd got all the photo evidence I needed, Mark Charlton going in,
Franny the Tranny coming out. Clear to anyone what he was up to. That was my
job done and dusted, photos taken on the digital camera. Could I leave it at
that? No! Big Mistake, my addiction kicked in. Even a card game with
transvestites, I had to get involved. In my wisdom, I'd decided to cheat, been
found out and had seven shades of shit beaten out of me in the alley.  
The door creaked open and I spun round with my fist clenched. Stacy came
towards me with a swab of bandages. I tried to think of something cool to say
but my brain was still missing a beat so I just took a snap of her instead.  
"Let me wipe you up," she whispered and began to swab me with bandages and
white towels. I pulled up a rickety wooden chair next to the sink and sat down
facing the mirror. "So what really happened?" she asked.  
Like an idiot I told her word for word. One golden rule for the private eye
was never to discuss cases with outsiders. With the beating I'd taken my brain
had turned to custard.  
She gently cleaned me up, wiping away the blood and soothing my bruises. I
stopped talking and stayed silent as she patched me up. I watched her; she
knew what she was doing. Her body was level with my eyes and I had a sudden
urge to grab and kiss her. I blinked the urges away. Christ! I didn't want to
get arrested for sexual assault on top of everything else.  
"So, you like a game of cards?" Stacy finally asked, breaking the silence.  
"Yeah, now and then," I nodded. I didn't want to let her know it was one of my
big weaknesses.  
"When I was working the bar tonight I overheard a couple of guys talking about
a big card game on Saturday night," she said.  
I felt my senses returning as my interest grew. "Tell me more." I surprised
myself by my reaction I saw in the mirror. I looked like a kid that was given
the keys to a candy store.  
"Well, the game is being played in a warehouse in Alphabet City."  
"Who's running the game?" I asked. My voice was deadpan like I was
interrogating a suspect.  
"The guy's called Andrei. He's Russian or Ukrainian or something. He comes in
here most days. I can ask him if he's got a spare place at the card table if
you want."  
"Sure thing, you do that," I smiled. "I'll give you my cell number and if I
win big I'll take you out for an expensive dinner."  
"You're on," she grinned.  
One of the pool playing regular Joes came in for a pee and did a double take
when he saw Stacy in the Mens. She giggled and kissed my forehead. I felt a
whole lot better and we went back to the bar. I drank another scotch and
chatted with Stacy for a while. We exchanged cell numbers. I figured I was
definitely onto something with her.  
The clock ticked past 4 am before Stacy asked me to go back to her place. I
felt too busted up for a night of love making and thought I really should be
taking a cab back to Brooklyn. That was the logical side of my brain thinking.
Fuck logic. Of course I went back with Stacy and although it hurt like hell, I
humped the ass off her.  
Without any sleep and feeling like shit, I took an early morning cab back to
Brooklyn. I reached my apartment in Vinegar Hill, showered, changed my clothes
and made a coffee with four spoonfuls and a shot of bourbon.  
I turned up suited and booted at the main office in Brooklyn Heights on time
at 9am. I drank a strong coffee and strolled into the boss's office at 0910.
The boss was Marvin Carter, he was a grade A asshole and he thought the same
of me. He only kept me employed because I did the jobs that no one else wanted
to do. Steve Haigh was in his late fifties and maybe too old, Oliver Reid had
a young family and Ellena Starr was, well a girl. I was Carter's sewer rat, he
always gave me the shitty jobs.  
"You look like shit, Max," Carter told me like I was a bad school kid.  
"Hey Marvin, I've got something for ya," I smiled. I rummaged around in my
jacket pocket and produced a fist with my second finger raised. "Fuck you
asshole," I said in my head.  
"Love you too," I blew a mock kiss.  
"Listen, Speed, I don't have time to fuck around here," Marvin was getting
pissed.  
"Okay man, don't go breaking my balls already," I gave in. My hangover started
to kick in. "I've got all you need on the Charlton case right here." I slammed
the digital camera down on his desk. "The guys a fuckin' faggot, okay. He
likes to dress in women's clothes that's all I know. If he's stickin' his dick
up someone's ass that's another matter. I don't get paid to take pictures of
gay porno stars, you got me!"  
Carter's attitude changed dramatically when he realized I had the pictures. He
picked up the camera and plugged it into his computer. I watched him click
through the incriminating evidence on the monitor. What a prick! He was a
couple of years younger than me but he looked ten years older. He was over
weight by at least twenty pounds, prematurely balding and had the dress sense
of a candy store clerk. I know I wasn't exactly Giorgio Armani but I knew I
looked better than Carter. His suits were crumpled like he slept in them.  
"Okay Max, these are good. I'll get these pictures printed off and close the
case," he nodded. He swung his chair around presumably to print the photos
from the camera. Carter swung his chair back around to look at me in an
unpleasant way. "Do you want to get a coffee or something?"  
"Whatever," I stood up and left Carters office. I knew I'd got what he wanted
otherwise he'd given me balls ache.  
I had a coffee with the charming secretary, Becky. She was half my age and I
knew she thought I was a complete jerk but that didn't stop me trying my luck.
She was dark eyed, dark haired, slim and very cute and she knew it. I tried to
impress her by telling her a funny story. She giggled, flicked her hair and
played Madonna on her MP3 speakers.  
I went outside into the street to catch some fresh air and smoke a cigarette.
Right then I thought about moving on from the job. I didn't know how much
longer I could stand working for that asshole Carter. His uncle, Peter had run
the place when I first started to work in the old red brick building nearly
twenty years ago. Peter was one of the good guys who knew how to look after
his staff. I figured if Marvin had an offer on the property from one of the
big retail boys, he'd sell and be off like a shot.  
A few years ago, poor old Peter came into work as usual, taken a client out
for lunch and while sitting in the diner he suffered one mother of a heart
attack. The guy was only fifty-eight, no age to meet your maker. Peter had
been a P.I. all his life. The lifestyle wasn't good for your health with the
late nights, the stress, the physical violence, the booze and substances to
keep you awake when coffee wasn't strong enough. I sighed as I realized that
I'd probably end up the same way, unless I was killed first.  
What I needed was a few good turns of the cards so I could quit the lifestyle
and retire to a condo in Florida or somewhere. Then I'd spend my days wearing
loud shirts while sitting in the sun, sipping a beer and listening to some old
Surf Rock 45's. A cold gust of wind blew me back to reality. I threw my
cigarette on the ground and stamped it out. Cigarettes weren't exactly good
for ones well being either. At least I'd cut down to around thirty a day,
still too many.  
I went back into the office to see what next assignment Marvin would give me.
I hoped it was going to be an easy one so I could get it done and dusted
before the card game the next day. It was. I could have kissed the horrible
bastard. Marvin gave me a straight forward case probably because of the way I
looked, all beaten and busted up. I flicked through the files and briefly skim
read the details. A rich, old guy called Mr. Steven Pym believed his not so
old wife was having an affair but he wasn't sure who with. These cases were
always pretty simple. Lust has a habit of blinding human beings to the point
of when they just say "to hell with it, I don't care anymore."  
There was a list of possible suspects with photographs. I studied the names
ages and occupations and then looked over the pictures. One candidate stood
out a mile, this case was going to be a cinch. Don't get me wrong, most of the
time my hunches and intuition checks out. Sometimes I get it wrong but not
very often. When you've been in the business as long as I have, you kind of
get a feel for these things.  
I put the photo of Mrs. Sylvia Pym and the smug smiling mug shot of her tennis
coach, Marco Rosen, side by side on my desk. They even looked like a couple.
She was two years older than him, which figured at thirty-two, he was thirty.
I reminded myself how old the pining Mr. Pym was. He was sixty-one, a self
made, wealthy businessman with offices in the Financial District. Sylvia was
wife number two. I went over the way it probably turned out in my head. She
became bored, he was impotent, she started tennis lessons, met a younger man,
was flattered he gave her attention, he thought rich older woman, they ended
up screwing, got careless, husband became suspicious and went to see Carter.
Bingo! I'd have this case sorted by sun down and have the whole weekend off.
That way I could concentrate all my efforts into the card game on Saturday
night.  
I stuffed all the paperwork and photos back in the file, told everyone in the
office I was working a new case and left the building. I picked up a pool car,
a Chrysler Grand Voyager, from the parking lot. I only took that vehicle
because I knew it would piss Carter off. He liked to use it on weekends to
take his family out of town.  
Wasting no time, I went to work. Mrs. Sylvia Pym was a lady of leisure so I
knew she wouldn't hang around with her adulterous habit. Sex in the afternoon
was probably a necessity for her, something for her and her friends to gossip
about over lunch in Soho perhaps or Tribeca. People like her did what they did
and when they were found out and confronted they wailed and moaned and begged
forgiveness for a while. After that they blamed the other partner, saying they
were bored or they didn't notice they were there or they never paid them any
attention. I'd seen it all before and I knew it made me cynical but what the
hell, I wanted to get this over and done with. I could almost smell that new
pack of cards being unwrapped, that shiny new plastic tang, with those half
smiling monarchs that were going to make me a winner.  
I drove over to the Pym's house in Chelsea. I quickly flicked through the file
and found the home telephone number. I dialed from my cell and used the old
wrong number ruse to see if she was home. It wasn't long before Sylvia
appeared out of the house. I took some pictures with the little digital
camera.  
Sylvia took a cab and I followed her to Union Square Park. I had some
difficulty finding a parking space and lost her. I swore, donned shades and
followed on foot armed with my digital camera. I knew she was meeting Rosen,
why else would she come here? I searched the park and soon found the happy
couple sitting on a bench. From a distance I pretended to mill around taking
pictures of nothing in particular. When they embraced or kissed or groped each
other I took a juicy shot. The date and times were logged on the camera.  
They sat on the bench for a while then moved on to a restaurant in Park Avenue
for lunch. I managed to hang back and use the zoom to intrude on their cozy
little feast. When they'd finished I followed them around to an apartment on
East 18th Street. I took some pictures of them going in the building and hung
out for about an hour chain-smoking and pacing up and down the sidewalk. This
was the part of the job that really sucked, the constant waiting around.  
An hour and a half later the adulterous Mrs. Pym appeared in the doorway
looking slightly disheveled. I took a few more snaps from across the street.
She gazed around for a few moments as if she was expecting to see someone
watching her. Little did she know there was someone watching i.e. me but she
was too dumb to realize, wrapped up in her own cozy little world of sleaze.  
I had everything I needed for now. I called Carter in the office at around 4
pm and told him I would be working the case over the weekend, there were a few
more details I needed. I knew Carter was pissed at me for taking the Grand
Voyager but he didn't say anything because he thought I'd be working my little
ass of all weekend.  
What I would do in reality was come back late Sunday afternoon, take a few
more snaps, job done. I'd tell Carter that I hung out all Saturday, freezing
my balls off and nothing went down. That way I'd be free all Saturday night
and Sunday morning for the card game. The game was close now, that's all I
could think about.  
  
Back in the small bar on Second Avenue, the blonde girl, was making a phone
call.  
"Hello, Andrei? Yes it's me, Freda. Everything is ready. The trap is set for
tomorrow night." She laughed and said "We are going to have some real assholes
at this card game. They really think they're going to win big. It'll be like
lambs to the slaughter."  
  
The next day was Saturday so I slept in till late, caught up with some paper
work, watched a ball game on TV and smoked too many cigarettes in the
afternoon. I was trying to kill time and keep my mind off the card game later.
I'd arranged to meet Stacy in the bar on Second Avenue at eight pm.  
I looked at the clock, it was only six. After showering and dressing in a
snazzy dark blue suit, I decided to take a slow walk from Brooklyn over the
bridge to Manhattan. I could catch a cab from Bowery to Second Ave.  
The sky was dark but clear and the air was Fall crisp. I breathed in the cool
air as I walked over the old iron bridge and took in the view of the bright
lights of Downtown Manhattan. The splashes and salty scent of the East River
drifted up from below the walkway.  
The night felt good, I felt good. The bruises and cuts from the other night
were healing. Tonight was going to be full of smiling monarchs and happy aces.
Tonight was going to be a blast.  
  
The blonde girl, Freda, was busy rounding up the card players from various
small bars around the East Village. She gave them each a scrap of paper with
the same address in Avenue D, Alphabet City. They all called her a different
name ranging from Anna to Zeta.  
  
I had a few drinks in a bar on Bowery and withdrew two thousand dollars from a
nearby ATM before taking a cab to the bar on Second Ave. I ordered a beer and
sat by the door and waited. Stacy came in a few moments later. She wore a big
pair of sunglasses that I found a bit strange.  
"Hi," I smiled. "Can I get you a drink?"  
"No thanks, Max," she seemed distant. "I can't stay. Here's the address of the
game tonight." She handed me a piece of notepaper. "Good luck Max. See ya
around."  
Stacy hurriedly took off through the door before I had a chance to speak. I
ordered bourbon from the fat gray slick behind the bar. He looked at me with
the same contempt he showed the other night. As I sipped the JD I wondered
what the hell had got into Stacy. Why had she blown me out like that? Well,
I'd stopped trying to work women out long ago. I necked back the drink and
left the dingy bar. Fat Man could shove his lousy attitude up his ass. I had a
game of cards to play.  
Back in the day, Alphabet City was a strictly no go area. They used to say
that if you were on Avenue A then you were alive. Avenue B you were brave,
Avenue C you were crazy, and Avenue D you were dead already.  
I took a cab to Avenue D between East 8th and East 4th Street. The actual
building looked like some sort of storage lock up. There were some other guys
that looked like players hanging out on the street. I didn't recognize any of
them. They looked kind of nervous and I had to admit that's exactly how I
felt. I paid the cab and took my place with the other guys. There were ten of
us in all.  
We stood on the sidewalk feeling awkward and checking our watches every thirty
seconds. Soon, a tall guy with long brown hair and a beard, dressed in a long
black trench coat appeared from around the corner.  
"Welcome, everyone," he gestured, holding his arms outstretched. "I am Andrei,
your host for this evening."  
Andrei spoke with a thick, east European accent and he reminded me of a
Russian Charles Manson. I had a bad feeling as we shuffled into the grimy lock
up.  
Inside there were no windows. A single stained light bulb swung from the
ceiling illuminating the room. Stacy described it as a warehouse, it was
anything but. Steel racks and wooden shelves loaded with old tools and tin
cans ran the lengths of the walls. It smelled of damp and I imagined rats
pissing all around the shelves.  
Andrei un-stacked some plastic chairs and placed them around a large round
wooden table in the middle of the room.  
"You got to be shitting me!" I heard someone say.  
Illegal gambling was rife in New York due to the lack of any big casinos as
such but even I thought this scenario was going back to the days of
prohibition. Andrei switched on some electric heaters and produced a few
bottles of vodka, some cans of soda and an odd assortment of glasses.  
"Come, let us drink, gamble and talk," he gestured towards the table.  
All the players, including me, reluctantly sat down. Andrei passed the drinks
around the table and most players helped themselves. I poured a large measure
of vodka into what looked like a flower vase.  
"We'll start with your limited pot Texas Hold'em," Andrei smiled opening a new
deck of cards.  
I breathed out nervously, took a long gulp of vodka and lit a cigarette. I was
getting the buzz.  
After a few hands it was obvious that most of these guys couldn't play cards
for shit. Only Andrei and another big sweaty guy opposite me were any good and
I reckoned with a bit of luck I could clean them out. The rest of the guys
bitched about bad hands and bad luck. They talked a good game but in truth
they probably just played cards with their college buddies or something.  
My two grand became five grand as the other guys folded when I held three
kings. An ace club flush saw my pot rise to $7 thousand. I gulped down some
more vodka. I was on a roll. I was going to wipe these guys out. Nothing was
going to stop me, nothing except a ski masked gunman sticking a Smith & Wesson
in my face.  
"Put the money in the fucking bag, big shot," he barked shoving a black
shoulder bag in my direction.  
There was nothing I could do, no way to fight my way out of this one. I
noticed another ski masked gunman standing by the door blocking the only exit.
He brandished what looked like a 38 caliber. I sighed and reluctantly stuffed
handfuls of dollars into the carrier.  
"Don't spend it all at once, asshole," I quipped.  
"Stop causing trouble," stammered the guy to my right. He was shaking like a
very small nun on a penguin shoot. "You'll get us all killed."  
I was just testing the gunman's nerve. It wasn't the first time that I'd had a
piece shoved in my face and if this bastard was going to rob me I think I was
entitled to insult him. For a few seconds we were eyeball to eyeball then he
turned away to the Sweat on the other side of the table. Somewhere in my
memory I knew I'd seen those eyes before but I couldn't remember where.  
Gunman 1 turned to Andrei after the Sweat had dumped his money into the bag.
Andrei stood up and spat on his notes then tossed them into the carrier.  
"You've ruined my game, you fucker," Andrei spat.  
"Sit the fuck down, punchy," Gunman 1 gestured with the handgun.  
Andrei began babbling in Russian or whatever language he spoke. Then he took a
gulp of vodka and spat it in Gunman 1's face. Gunman 2 moved away from the
door and came closer to the table.  
"What's the problem?" he called.  
"This Russian prick's got a big problem," Gunman 1 spluttered and wiped his
face. He then smashed his gun into Andrei's face.  
Andrei went down like a sack of shit. The rest of us at the table rose to our
feet.  
"I'm going to teach this piece of shit some manners," Gunman 1 menaced.  
I took a couple of slow steps back into the shadows and hid behind some steel
racking. The other players slowly crept towards the door. I wasn't going to
chance bolting from my hiding place. I'd be the last one out and if the gunman
were going to start shooting people then I'd be first.  
"Go on, get out of here!" Gunman 2 bellowed after the fleeing card players.  
They bolted for the exit and fell through the doorway in a big heap. I kept
out of sight and was morbidly fascinated to see what happened next. Would they
execute Andrei or just give him a slap?  
Gunman 2 moved to the door and checked the card players were all gone.  
"Yeah, they've all run of with their dicks limp and their wallets empty," he
laughed. He shut the door and bolted it from inside.  
I heard more laughing and watched Gunman 1 pull Andrei to his feet.  
"Did you have to hit me so God damn hard?" Andrei smiled wiping blood from his
face.  
"I had to make it look real, man," Gunman 1 chuckled and slapped Andrei on the
shoulder.  
They pulled off their ski masks and I recognized them from the bar on Second
Ave, the two jerks playing pool in the corner. The bastards! The whole thing
was a set up from the start. I felt my anger rising. That little bitch Stacy
probably had something to do with it and that fat prick behind the bar. I
wouldn't have given a fuck if I'd lost at cards tonight but that was my money,
I'd won it fair.  
Well, these jerks had picked on the wrong guy if they thought they were going
to get away with this little scam!  
  
Andrei and the two gunmen sat down at the table and counted the money. They
talked, laughed and drunk vodka until they finished.  
"We got just over twenty grand here," Andrei smiled. "Not bad for a nights
work."  
I wanted to race over there and beat the crap out of them. There was no way I
could take three of them on, especially as two of them were armed. If only I'd
had my camera on me I could've taken a shot. A sudden thought jolted in my
head. I'd have to sort this out my way.  
I stayed in the shadows and crept towards the door. They didn't see me as I
quietly slipped out into the night.  
Thinking and smoking hard, I walked west towards Second Avenue. When I arrived
at the bar there was no sign of Stacy or the fat barman. I waited and drunk. I
tried her cell number. The number was not recognized. I walked round to her
apartment. There was no one there, the place was deserted. I'd been taken for
a ride, thrown out and dumped in the gutter.  
In a fury, I made my way back to the bar on Second Ave. Before I went in I
looked outside for any type of clothing store. Stacy told me she worked in one
two doors down, of course the store didn't exist. I lurched into the bar and
poured drink after drink down my throat. Swearing and cursing under my breath,
I vowed revenge. I signaled for a refill.  
"Don't you think you've had enough, buddy?" came the reply.  
I looked up and saw the fat gray haired barman. I slipped off my stool,
reached over the bar and grabbed him by the shirt collars.  
"Hey, you better cut that out, buddy or I'll kick your ass," he shouted.  
"Where is she?" I demanded. "That little blonde bitch."  
"Get the hell off me, man," the barman shrugged me off and took a step back.
"You best get out of here, buddy or I'll have you arrested."  
I knew I was making a fool out of myself and people in the bar were staring at
me in horror. I must have looked like a complete asshole.  
"Sorry, man," I stammered. "I just want to know if you know where Stacy is."  
"Who?" asked the fat man. "There's no one called Stacy here."  
"That blonde girl I was with the other night. She said she worked here."  
"Oh, her, she's never worked here," the fat man spat. "Listen buddy, a piece
of advice, if some piece of ass gives you the brush off, don't come in here
giving me a hard time over it. You got that? Now get the hell out!"  
Slowly, it dawned on me that everything she'd told me was a lie. I had no
choice but to leave the bar. I took a cab home and stopped off at a liquor
store on route to pick up one of my Scottish friends. I got back to my
apartment and drank myself into oblivion.  
When Monday came around I still felt like shit. At least Carter was happy with
the pictures I'd taken in the Pym case so it was another result for him. As
for me, I had my own case going on. I used Becky's computer to print the photo
I'd taken of Stacy in the men's room that night in the bar on Second Ave.  
The next assignment Carter gave me was another easy one. I had to pose as an
employee for a major retail store to catch a thief. I was to be there all
week. These cases were always good for several reasons, a) good looking women
always worked in these kinds of stores, b) I could disappear at any time and
bullshit my way out of it, c) the other workers liked to play cards in their
break and were all crap players. It was only small change but a win is a win,
right?  
At lunch time I arranged to meet up with my old friend Patrick Feeney from the
NYPD in an Irish bar on Bleecker Street. Me and Patrick went back quite a few
years. We always swapped information over a wobbly coffee, that's coffee with
a shot if you didn't know. I told him the whole seedy little story from start
to finish then handed him the photo of Stacy and the address of the lock up in
Alphabet City. He looked at both with disdain.  
"Max, you are a filthy pig, so you are," he scoffed. "What the hell were you
thinking? Hanging out with scrubbers and then playing cards with Russians you
don't know in a garage in one of the most dangerous places in town." He shook
his head. "Jesus Christ! It sounds fucking great," he laughed. "This is going
to cost you, Max. Irish Malt is at a premium these days."  
We finished our wobbly coffees and went back to our jobs, Patrick to his
police work and me to my retail store. In late afternoon, I was getting ready
to finish up for the day when my cell rang.  
"Max, it's Patrick. That girl you're looking for, I've got something for you.
Her real name is Freda Kovak and she lives in the East Village." He gave me
the address. I knew Patrick was putting himself on the line for me here. No
one was supposed to give out names and addresses anymore.  
"Thanks Paddy, you've earned your bottle of Irish."  
"That lock up you went to, it's owned by a small Ukrainian Shipping Company.
They own another one further up Avenue D on the corner of Roosevelt Drive."
Feeney spoke in a hushed tone like there was somebody listening in.  
"Paddy? Are you Okay?" I muttered.  
"Max, do me a big favor and just stay way from this one, okay?"  
"Why? What's the big deal?"  
"Go and see the girl and leave it there, Max. Please."  
The phone went dead. What was going on? I'd never heard Patrick Feeney plead
with me before. I was too consumed with thoughts of revenge to listen.  
I drove my pool car out to First Avenue after my shift at the retail store. I
found the address of Stacy/Freda's place and waited outside in the car. I
smoked for a few hours listening to the radio. Eventually, she showed up,
although I didn't recognize her at first. She wore a long, dark wig under a
woolen beanie hat and big glasses. Slipping quietly out of the car, I followed
her to her door.  
As Stacy was inserting her key in the lock, I grabbed her arm and spun her
around.  
"You set me up," I spat.  
She looked shocked for a moment. "What are you doing here? How did you find
me?"  
"Where's my money and where's that bastard Andrei?"  
"Get the fuck off me!" she screeched.  
I knew it was dangerous to go around grabbing people from behind in New York
City, especially women. I calmed myself down and let her go.  
"I just want five minutes of your time," I explained coolly.  
She looked apprehensive then nodded. "Five minutes Max, that's all." She
gestured for me to go inside.  
The room was cramped with cheap, old furniture and the light was dim. There
was a faint smell of cat piss coming up from the threaded carpet.  
"Very nice," I joked, staring around.  
"Cut the crap, Max," Stacy spat. "It's a shit hole. I don't need you to tell
me."  
"It's a bit different to the other place, isn't it Stacy or is it Freda?" I
was being cute and enjoying every second.  
"Listen Max, just say what you gotta and then get out of here. I have to be
someplace so call me a bitch or whatever you want to say because the clock is
ticking." She lit a cigarette and looked surprisingly tearful.  
"All I want to know is why did you rip me off?" I asked softly. "I was stupid
enough to think that you really liked me."  
"I did," she howled. "I didn't sleep with any of those other guys that were at
the lock up." Stacy took a long draw and exhaled smoke. "Listen, I hate Andrei
and the others as much as you do. I have to recruit guys for the card scam to
pay off debts for the family company."  
"That doesn't happen to be a Ukrainian Shipping Company does it?" I sighed.
"The one that owns the lock ups?"  
She nodded. "Andrei did a deal and took over the company and the debts. He's
ripped a lot of people off and has loads of enemies."  
"Well, he's made a bad one here," I snarled. "When is his next game? That's
all I want to know. I want to show up at his little card school and give him a
lesson he won't forget."  
"Tonight," she said. "At the other lock up in Alphabet City."  
"Come on then. Let's go and get even."  
  
Andrei's scam seemed to have worked perfectly again. He knew he didn't have
many more times to pull this off. The police had come sniffing around the lock
ups wanting to speak to a tall Russian. Obviously, some of the card players
had reported robberies but couldn't recount too much incriminating
information. The two red necked gunmen would soon be disposed of, probably in
the Hudson River on a routine trip back to the Ukraine. The girl had become
tiresome and outgrown her usefulness. The lock ups could still be used for
storing weapons, drugs or other lucrative commodities.  
Bang on time, the two masked gunmen burst through the door to scare the card
players shitless again. Andrei went through his usual routine of abuse and
protests. This time he was hit in the face even harder than the last. Not once
but several times. Then when he was on the ground he was kicked as well. He
was going to have to have strong words with the fucking red neck; he was
getting too carried away.  
The card players fled the building in blind panic. Andrei lay on the floor
moaning in pain. The gunman rifled through his pockets and took away a small
handgun.  
"What are you doing?" Andrei mumbled through broken teeth. "You are a dead
man!"  
The gunman winked and smiled and slapped the Ukrainian in the face. Andrei
knew that this gunman wasn't his red neck accomplice.  
"Don't feel so good to be ripped off does it?" the gunman whispered in a
Brooklyn accent.  
He handcuffed Andrei to the metal racks.  
"Let me go, you fucking pig," Andrei squealed.  
The gunman winked again and picked up the bag with the money in. He smiled at
the smaller accomplice and nodded towards the door.  
Five minutes later, Detective Inspector Patrick Feeney of the NYPD received an
anonymous call from a woman informing him that some wanted felons were in a
lock up on Avenue D, Alphabet City. The arresting officer was quickly on the
scene.  
  
On a break from the retail store the following day, I picked up a copy of the
morning paper. A few faces I recognized stared out from a bizarre headline. I
saw a bad photo of Andrei, the two red necks and the fat gray haired barman.
"Undercover Cop Breaks Robbery Gang Scam," the headline almost yelled out.  
I read the piece as I walked to the bank. The fat barman had been working
undercover for a month trying to find the mysterious Russian that turned out
to be Ukrainian. The undercover cop had single handedly arrested the
perpetrators at the scene. The police were still looking for a woman in
connection with the robberies.  
I laughed out loud as the paper hailed the cop as a modern day hero. My cell
rang, it was Patrick Feeney.  
"I told you to stay away, Max. I think you owe me two bottles of Irish now."  
"I don't know what you mean, Paddy," I said, shocked.  
"You nearly blew Beech, the fat barman's cover. I knew he was on it but I
couldn't tell you that."  
"He still came up smelling of roses, though," I flicked his photo on the
paper. "He was the arresting officer."  
"Yes, but there was no money found at the scene and the two accomplices were
found handcuffed together and to the steering wheel of their car. They claim
to have been tricked by a girl matching your Stacy's description. She was the
only one who would have known when the next card school was."  
"Maybe," I smiled.  
"Where is she now, Max?"  
"Why are you asking me?"  
"She was part of the investigation. She knew we had an undercover man in there
although she didn't know who. Those lock ups belonged to her but now she's
vanished."  
"I wouldn't know anything about that," I smiled.  
"Watch your back, Max. I'm telling you as a friend." Feeney was serious.
"You've put a few people's noses out of joint, be careful."  
"Paddy, you know me. I'm always careful."  
Patrick Feeney hung up his phone. I made my way into the bank and deposited
$11,768, which was exactly my half of the cash minus the cost of two bottles
of Irish Malt. Today felt good, today was going to be a blast.
