I coughed. It was dark and cold walking down the street. I had left my car at
a street corner and pretended to be walking to get gas. i didn't want anyone
to see me. Especially my husband. J.R.'s appartment building loomed into view
and i picked up the pace, practically sprinting to his floor and throwing
myself at his door.  
"Ryan! open up! It's me." I whispered at his door. The door flew open and Ryan
grabbed my waist and pulled me inside. He pushed me up against the wall and
picked me up, i wrapped my legs around his waist and he started kissing me.  
"The first girl I ever loved happens to be my brother's wife." he whispered in
my ear as i kissed his neck. We crashed through the dining room and I stopped.  
"Where's Fran?"  
"Out at a movie with her dearly beloved." We kissed some more when the phone
rang. He seemed not to notice.  
"The phone-" I breathed  
"No."  
"It will be suspicious if you dont get it." He stopped and looked at me and
set me down.  
"I dont care!" he cried. I was taken back by his severity. "Let them find us!
I CAN"T TAKE THIS!'  
"What? What can't you take?!"  
"THIS... you and him. I sit up sometimes at night thinking of what you two are
doing at that moment and it makes me sick. I can't stand to see him touch you
or look at you the way he does." His answering machine interupted his stream
of words.  
"Hey J.R. it's me, Karen. I had a wonderful time last night. I never had a
chance to say I love you too! call me back baby. bye." I glared at him.  
"Listen she was this-"  
"I dont want to hear your explanation. I dont care." I shoved him away,
walking for the door. He grabbed my arm.  
"I pretended she was you. That's what i do with every girl."  
"That's rich. You've had a lot of time to practice this little speech, haven't
you? You say it to everyone, right?"  
"No." His firm tone was asserting. "Believe me, I would LOVE to be in love
with anyone else. But I can't help it. Every minute you're gone is a minute I
spend wondering where you are and what you're doing. You're driving me crazy,
food doesn't taste good any more, sleep is pointless...unless it's with you.
Jack is my enemy and rival, I want to be better than him in everything for one
reason only, you. I dont want him to touch you and sometimes I have to walk
away to keep from punching me. I was excited to think we might've had a baby
cause I thought maybe he would leave the picture. You're my world." I stood in
front of him hanging on every word, looking into his eyes. Man he's
attractive.  
"I..." I reached up and again we were kissing. He was kissing me so
passionately i could barely breathe. The phone rang.  
"Shut up!" he yelled at it.  
"Answer it." I mumbled between his kisses. He reached over, still kissing me
and picked it up.  
"Hello? Oh, hey. Yeah ok, i'll be right there." He hung up. "Fran...'  
"Yeah, I should get going anyway." He drove me to my car and I drove home.  
  
Jack was on the couch and when he saw me he jumped up and kissed me.  
"MHM. delicious." He whispered.  
"Well if it isn't my huband. What are you doing round here?" I asked with a
smile.  
"Actually i just came to get my favorite shirt but i'll be leaving soon."  
"Oh that's a shame, i thought maybe if you wanted to stick around..." I pulled
down one side of my shirt, exposing a bra strap. "I'm not wearing any
panties." I said. There was a knock on the door.  
"Don't forget that thought." Jack said as he stood up. "I figure I could maybe
stick around." He smiled. I heard the door open and voices in the parlor grow
louder. Suddenly my father burst into the room.  
"WHAT?" Jack was saying as he followed my dad in.  
"Holly!" My dad said with an air of surprise.  
"I do live here Dad, what's going on?"  
"The base is under attack."  
"What?" I cried.  
"Our local mobs decided to band together to attack the base. They have it
under control." He said with a glint of rage in his eyes. I looked at Jack and
he nodded.  
"We're going in." I said to my dad.  
"No Holly."  
"I'm sorry, but you can't stop us." I said. "I'm still your little girl dad,
but i'm not a child."  
"Jack reason with her." he said, turning to face Jack.  
"But I agree with her sir. something must be done. Our files and weapons...
they could take over the city." My father gazed at him for a while and then
nodded slowly.  
"Okay. but I'm going too."  
jack and I ran upstairs to our closets. Pulling on some clothes and our bullet
proof vests we strapped guns and weapons to our clothes and limbs. Jack looked
so handsome in fighting gear. I knew one of my sworn adversries, Quin, was
behind this. We had run into each other a few times before and I was still
trying to pin him for illegal drug trafficing. He was the leader of the West
side gang. Sear was the leader of the Irish gang in the South side of the
city. Mysterial was a very troubled city located in South Carolina where Jack
and I were settled. I looked at Jack again and sighed. He kissed me gently and
then more passionately.  
"I love you." he said penetrating me with his bright green eyes.  
"I love you too Jack." and i meant it.  
  
Our headquarters was located in a warehouse down by the shipping dock. It was
eerily silent. They knew there would be some to try a counter attack, that was
for sure. My dad was in front of us, and he kicked open the door to the lobby
and panned the room holding out his gun. He motioned for us to come in.  
"All clear." We saw all the doors for the different sections of the forces of
the UDCU, rush mates, independant fighters, so forth and so on. Jack was a
commander of the third division of rush forces and I was an independant
fighter under the command of Commander Hughes. My father was the Cheif
Commander, which meant he was the top/head of the whole thing. My dad stopped
us there.  
"I'll go to the commander in trainings room, Holly you to the Independant
fighters and Jack you get the rush forces if we can take these rooms back
maybe we can take the whole thing."  
"But if they overwhelemed everyone by sheer number than how can we help?" I
asked.  
"See this Holly?" My dad asked pointing to the keypad. Every door had a
personal key pad security system. All of them were blinking red. I nodded.
"Well, this means the whole place is on lockdown mode. the only way we can
help is buy breaking through the barriers undetected and freeing the hostages
they have, which is everyone in the building. The IF's are probably in the
training room as with the rush forces. Listen. they probably have more people
than us since all the mobs formed together. but if we can sneak out all the
divisions into one room, lets go for this room...than we probably have more
expirence than they do. They trapped everybody when they were in their own
assigned rooms, taking them by force. take out the guards and get the masses
out into here okay?" We nodded. "Good luck."  
I crawled keyed in the code and slowly opened the door. I heard footsteps
behind the door. I swung it open hard, heard the thunk and a body sunk to the
ground.  
"HEY!" I grabbed my dart gun and silenced him with a dart.  
"McKenley?" I heard another mobster inquire. His footsteps grew closer. I
leveled the gun and shot him as he came around the corner. He grabbed his neck
wound and sunk unconious to the floor. I heard yelling and arguing in the
common room so I crawled into a vent as silently as possible. I took a right
at the first intersection and kept crawling. All of a sudden the pipe creaked.
I stopped and listened.  
"You hear that?"  
"Naw, what?"  
"Nevermind." I exhaled and put my hand slowly in front of me as the pipe
groaned loudly and the nailing that connected the two popped out. I screamed
as I went flying out of the pipe onto the ground in the middle of about twenty
mobsters. They looked surprised for a moment and then took out their guns I
got up and started running, pulling guns out of my holster as I went. I shot a
few guys but not before they started shooting at me. I ducked and pushed some
out of the way, now running towards the virtual training room. One pursued
with a big metal pipe in his hand. He dove and grabbed my calf, tripping me. I
fell hard on the ground and kicked at him. Bullets had peirced my vest and
they ached but hadn't got to me, luckily. I coughed and spit out some blood
but kept dodging his blows. Behind I saw some more guys catching up. I
screamed and kicked him in the face, sending him sputtering and coughing. I
tried to crawl away from his reach but he reached out with the metal pole and
hit me on my side. I cried out in agony but stumbled to stand up and
ran/limped to the closest room, the bathroom. I lovked the door but soon there
was banging and shouting. I stumbled across the tiled floor and saw the small
vent opening above one of the toilets. Jumping on the toilet seat i ripped off
the vent and tried to climb inside. There was nothing to grab a hold of, so I
jumped hard and tried to catch my fingers on the overlapping of the pipes.
They did catch and it hurt like heck. I hauled myself into the vent as
shooting burst open the door. I shimmied down the vent as the pipe behind me
was ripped by bullets. I kept moving and tried to vainly cover my head. I
finally saw the training room and kicked out the vent cover. The people inside
were looking at me and some shook their heads indicating that i should leave.
I knew this was an ambush. Of course they got here first! I kicked myself for
being so dumb. I tried to quickly retreat but a gang member leapt out and
leveled his gun at me.  
"Get out here." He spoke roughly. I was trapped, and I heard a muffled
explosion from down the pipe and before I could move gusts of wind and fire
threw me from the pipe. I hit the ground hard and rolled over, coughing. The
man who had spoke to me had black hair with a five o'clock shadow. He looked
to be in his thirties and spoke with an accent. He pulled mme to my feet. He
was clearly the leader and vaguely familiar. "Stand up."  
"Get away from me." I spat as he grabbed my arm and pulled me to my feet.  
"What's with the hostility?" He said. "Dont remember me? Your old school mate
Gavin?" He sneered. I groaned. Gavin was a few grades ahead of me in high
school. He robbed a convient store when I was in it but he spared my life
under the condition I would never tell. But I did, and he consequently got
thrown in jail. "Every day in that jail I waited. Waited to get out so I could
pay you back for the promise you broke." He picked up and object and swinging
hard I was thrown into a world of blackness.  
  
I felt something cold on my face. Something wet. I opened my eyes only to see
a light that made me close them again. I was gagged and couldn't move. I felt
my hands and the ropes that bound them. My feet were bound too and I was
sitting in a chair.  
"I'm sorry." Gavin said "Was that in your eyes?" I opened them again and
glared. "I do love to see your beautiful eyes though." he licked my face and I
bashed my head into his. "Fiesty." He sneeered rubbing his head. My legs were
tied to the chair and my waist was bound to the chair also. He looked around
him. "See what your great rescuer has become?" he called to my fellow IFs. "A
lowly hostage."  
"Let her go!" My friend Jess yelled. Gavin made a motion with his hand and
immdeiately I heard some screams and a big thud. I screamed through my gag.  
"Scream all you want missy." He came over and slapped me across the face. I
tasted blood and my face stung. He turned his head, cracking his neck. "I've
been waiting a long time to do that. You have no idea how good it felt." I
glared. "Boone can't save you now honey." Tears filled my eyes and poured down
my face. "Jack can try but, what about J.R?" I felt my throat close. "I've
been watching you Holly. You've been a bad girl." My heart was bursting with
rage and fury. He was going to tell Jack. I loved him more than anyone. I
guess that was the difference between love and lust. The door burst open and
Jack was thrown into the room by two of the gangsters. He was cut and bleeding
in some areas and he had a black eye. He was limping and he looked like he was
in pain and i wanted nothing else but to help him, to take care of him, to
love him. He was so attractive even when he was beaten up.  
"Let go." Jack said as he shoved some of the men off.  
"Good work boys." Gavin nodded and they left the room. "Jack, Jack, Jack. My
name's Gavin. Nice to meet you."  
"Let her go."  
"Or what?"  
"Or i'll make you."  
"Very charming. But you know, I have a score to settle with her." Jack stood,
his hands balling into fists, grinding his teeth. "Oh, don't try to fight me
just yet. i want you concious to hear what I have to say. You know, Holly
has-" I cut him off with a scream of terror. "Shutup. Holly has been doing
your brother." I started crying. Jack's face was pale. "Oh come on Jack, don't
act so innocent." he turned to me. "Jack has also been naughty."  
"Shut up!" he screamed  
"You know that blonde in his rush force?" Gavin screamed over Jack. "he's been
doing her too. Looks like an unsatisfying marriage to me." I felt my blood run
cold and tears pour from my eyes. Jack and my eyes met and he suddenly rushed
at Gavin, punching him hard. Gavin fell and Jack tried to jump on him and pin
him but Gavin rolled out of the way but Jack was fighting with such ferocity I
had never seen he compensated quickly and grabbed Gavin. He held him down and
punched him continually until Gavin screamed for his men. They came and picked
up Jack, kneeing him in the gut. He doubled over and Gavin stood up, wiping
his blood on his sleeve then proceeded to hit Jack a few times. He gagged Jack
and grabbed him.  
"You're gonna watch this." he whispered to me. Two of the men held Jack up and
Gavin took out a knife. He walked over to Jack and cut his arm. Jack moaned
and squeezed his eyes closed. I screamed through my gag and Gavin plunged the
kinfe below Jack's shoulder. Jack screamed through his gag. I couldn't take it
anymore. I was infuriated. He wasn't going to win. I kicked my legs to the
side and the legs of the chair broke. The chair fell foward and I leaned
foward and broke the back of the chair. I sliced my bonds on the ragged edge
of the chair and pulled out the legs from where they were still tied to mine.
Already men were moving towards me and I plunged the wooden legs into their
stomachs. I went for Gavin. He tried to punch me but i side stepped and
brought my knee into his groin. he leaned over and I cracked his head on my
other knee. Finally I sidekicked him in his side and roundkicked him across
his face. He fell unconsious with a thud. I ripped off my gag. And the two
guys holding Jack stepped away. He fell but I caught him.  
"Oh God Jack I love you so much. Your brother doesn't mean half as much to me
as you do and if you never want to see me again I understand." he looked at me
for a little while. and finally after an eternity he said  
"I dont think it's going to work out." My heart stopped beating and as i
turned my head and tears welled up in my eyes he continued. "With me and
anyone else. I've discovered that. I hope you have too."  
"Jack, do you think we can get through this?"  
"I'll go through anything to get you."  
"Do you love me?"  
"I thought I was going to lose you tonight. I have never loved you more." I
kissed him and some people clapped. Smiling I turned but heard some screams
and a searing pain flooded my body.  
"You still might lose her." Gavin breathed. I looked down to see a kinfe
protruding from my body. "No couples can get through that!" He cried with the
tone of a madman.  
"If they really love each other-" I gasped.  
"NO!" he shreiked. "If you don't live in misery you wont live at all!" He
cried frantically. A shot rang through the air. My father was standing in the
doorway and Gavin crumpled to the floor. Jack grabbed me as I fell. I thought
of all we had been through. From the first time we met in the parking lot, to
the death of my other fiancee Boone, to our baby's death, and now our lusts
getting the better of us.  
"I'm not going to let you go." Jack said to me. "Ever."  
  
I opened my eyes and groaned. My body felt sore and numb.  
"Mrs. Paler! You're finally awake." A nurse stood beside my bed. "You were out
cold for a while and same with your husband. You slept through your stiches
healing. You're a fast healer and a lucky woman." she said "You have a
visitor." I looked towards the door and saw a nurse wheeling jack into my room
in a wheelchair. He had a sling on and looked bruised and cut. He stood up and
walked over to me. I managed a weak smile.  
"Hey." my voice came out as a strained whisper.  
"Hi." He looked into my eyes. He leaned down and kissed me, gently, brushing
his lips against mine. I could feel his breath on my lips. He finally kissed
me more assertively and before I knew it we were kissing heatedly.  
"Okay...not here." The nurse said nervously. But I barely heard her. I wanted
Jack more than anything, and (of course) that's when J.R. showed up. He stood
awkwardly in the doorway and coughed. Jack stood up and looked at him. Okay,
good. No dramatic reaction... maybe this will be okay. I thought assuringly. I
thought too soon. Jack lunged across the room and punched Ryan in the face
with his left arm his weaker arm, but still J.R fell. Jack leapt on him and
started to pummel him, I got up and ran across the room trying to break it up.
Ryan eventually punched back and the started to struggle.  
"Someone get security!" The nurse called down the hallway. The boys were
wrestling for control, getting in a punch when possible, I tried to pry Ryan
away but he kept nudging me off and going for Jack again. I went to try and
get Jack, and security came running down the hall. I grabbed Jack's arm and he
turned and slapped me.  
"Oh my God Holly I'm so sorry I thought-" they had stopped fighting.  
"You see Holly. He's no good for you. He HIT you! I love you more." Jack
turned and punched him hard across the face.  
"Never claim that...ever again." Jack yelled at his brother and the security
guards grabbed his arms to restrain him.  
A minute later we were all on the curb in our clothes Jack with more cuts and
J.R. with a black eye. None of us said anything. Ryan turned as if to talk but
decided to stay quiet. Finally he said  
"I'll drive you home."  
"Go to hell." Jack spat. J.R. came over to me. Jack's hand balled into a fist
and I could see his muscles tighten as he tried to control himself.  
"Holly. Come with me." Ryan held out his hand to me. I looked at him, and then
to Jack who stood , enviously awaiting my decision. "Please. I know you want
to smooth things over with my brother, but I love you and would never
consciously hurt you. He'll leave you for someone else and I might not be
still waiting." his words made my heart beat faster and I considered his deal.
Jack might leave me. I knew there would be a talk with him and his mistress
soon and he might actually choose her. I swallowed.  
"Ryan, I..." He sensed I was trying to choose my words and kicked the stop
sign angrily.  
"Don't you see?" He yelled "He doesn't love you like I do!"  
"That's not true Holly." Jack said  
"Yes!" cried a frantic J.R. "yes it is! You came to me for a reason." Finally
Jack had enough, he punched Ryan across the face and sent him onto the
pavement. I ran over to help him. But he crawled to his feet and stumbled
away. Jack came over and grabbed my waist with his good arm.  
  
A few days later, the inevitable happened. I went to the luchroom for my lunch
break and looked at Jess.  
"I'll be right back. I have to pee." I walked down the hall but turned right
to see if Jack and his rush force were stopping their training for lunch. I
heard Jack's voice.  
"No...I know. I'm sorry." I thought he was on the phone until I heard a
woman's voice.  
"You said things were getting boring with her." her whiny voice penetrated my
ears. He said that?  
"No, I said..."  
"you can't even remember what you said anyways."  
"well I love her."  
"than why, did you give me one of the greatest-"  
"It was a mistake."  
"After all that- thats the only thing you can say? It was a mistake? You are
so lame."  
"I've transfered you." he said  
"Come on Jack... I thought you loved me."  
"There's only one girl for me. She's not you." I heard a slapping sound.  
"You ass!" she cried. "I am so much prettier. She's gonna cheat again. You
know it, but I will never leave you baby." He was silent. After what seemed
like an eternity he said.  
"I'm sorry-" I peeked around the corner. She had him backed into a wall, he
was trying to push her away and her lips almost touched him. I felt rage boil
inside me.  
"Hey." I snapped at her. She turned to look at me and I walked closer. "Back
off...bitch." I punched her across the face and she fell, screaming. "Don't
act so innocent." I sneered. I leapt on top of her and punched her in the face
again. She punched me in the stomach where my stiches had been. I coughed and
doubled over and rolled on to the ground next to her.  
"How'd that feel?" She said with disdain.  
"Probably about as good as you do." I shot back. Her mouth dropped open. She
started kicking sideways at me but I quickly hauled myself off the floor and
grabbed her hair, pulling her up. She screamed loudly. A crowd had gathered
near the entrance to the vending room, where we were fighting.  
"Holly!" Jack yelled. "Bridgette!" We didn't hear. She scratched me across the
face and I slapped her. She tried to punch but I ducked and tried to kick her
legs out from under her. She leapt up and I leveled with her I ducked another
punch and while I was down punched her hard in the stomach. Now people were
trying to stop me but I shrugged them off. She was doubled over I kneed her in
the face, which sent her sprawling back against the wall. Choking she stumbled
foward and I swung my fist back and punched her across the face so hard she
fell to the floor, unconsious. people grabbed me and pinned me down and also
grabbed her, fanning her. We were taken to my father's office.  
  
Bridgette was coming around and finally people set her forcefully in a chair
in front of my father's desk. I could hardly stand to be seated next to her.  
"What in the heck is going on here?" My father exclaimed forcefully. Before
Bridgette could say anything I blurted out  
"She's been doing Jack." My dad's mouth fell open.  
"Impossible." He said "He loves you." Bridgette snorted and I lunged towards
her but before I could punch or anything two commanders grabbed me and forced
my back down. "Thank you." he said nodding at them.  
"All he wanted was a little bimbo to fool around with." Bridgette tried to get
at me but again was forced down into her seat.  
"Obviously someone wasn't satisfying him."  
"Oh. So he did what guys usually do and called a whore." We lunged, but they
pried us apart.  
"UGLY!"  
"HUSSY!"  
"LADIES!" My father cried. "Obviously we have a problem here. Bridgette has
been transfered but as your punishment for fighting let it be known that
neither of you can move up in rank for five years." Our cries of protest were
silenced. "THAT is all. Thank you." He dissmissed us with a wave of his hand
and the commanders assissted us to our assigned station rooms. I stormed into
my training room locker area. Jess popped up.  
"I heard you beat up Bridgette the Bimbo."  
"Damn straight."  
"Nice." She high fiived me.  
"...but" I continued "I can't move in rank for five years."  
"What??"  
"That's the penalty." She looked behind me suspiciously.  
"I'll catch you around" She said suddenly and left.  
"can I talk to you?" Jack's voice justified her leaving.  
"Yeah."  
"How much did you hear."  
"Only that you told her you didn't love me." I said shuffling through things
in my locker.  
"That's not true. Don't listen to her."  
"How can I not?" I cried  
"Simple. Listen to me." I took a deep breath in and exhaled.  
"okay." he smiled and kissed me.  
  
I got home that night after Jack had left. He had stated that he had some
buisness to do but I wasn't suspicious. He had gotten a call and waved
goodbye, leaving me to drive home by myself. I opened the front door and
closed it behind me, locking the deadbolt. Click. The sound flashed pictures
through my mind.  
"Don't think." I saw Ryan in my mind's eye. He carried me upstarirs. Taking
off my skirt as I fumbled with his belt. My hands grabbing handfuls of the
sheets. His towel coming off. "Take a shower with me."  
I could stand it no longer and I opened my eyes, and stumbled into the living
room. I heard the back door close. Compose yourself.  
"Jack. I thought you'd be gone longer-" I walked into the kitchen. Ryan was
standing by the fridge. "Ryan?" he just looked at me. "Ryan? whta are you
doing here?" I gasped.  
"coming to get you."  
"Ryan, please."  
"No! I tried to accept you and Jack but I can't I just...can't." He took a few
steps toward me.  
"You're scaring me."  
"Why? There's nothing wrong with me. I'm perfectly sane!" He yelled. "I was
hit on today you know." he nodded furiously "by a lady at the bank. good
looking woman but I didn't respond and I didn't even think of how nice it
would be to go on a date or hold hands in public. All I thought about was how
I could never make love to someone quiet like how I did you. Real passion and
real feelings. Thats all I have and I can only have it for you. You, you, you!
Thats all I think about, all I dream about, all I care about." He looked at me
crazily. I could barely understand what he was saying.  
"Ryan...don't do this."  
"Oh I'm doing it and I love that I am." He walked towards me and started
kissing me.  
"No!" I cried "Stop!" He grabbed me forcefully. "Ouch, Ryan you're hurting
me." I started crying. He started kissing me again and I tried to fight away.
"Lunacy is NOT a turn on!" I cried slapping him in the face. He grabbed my
wrist tightly. "Ouch! Stop!"  
"Shut up." He growled. He grabbed my wrist so forcefully I thought he might
break it. He started pulling me into the next room, I knew where he was going.  
"AH!" I screeched and started to kick at him feebly. I was getting tired. He
must've somehow kown that I'd already been in a fight today. I fought and
stood my ground but he pulled me over so I almost hit the ground hard but he
still had a hold on my wrist and I was caught by it. He continued moving and
dragging me along through the living room. I kicked and screamed loudly but he
silenced me by a kick. He leaned over and put tape on my mouth. He dragged me
up the stairs and into my bedroom.  
"I remember this place." He said sinisterly. I kicked and flailed but it was
no use. He threw me on to the bed and pulled out a small knife. "Let's see how
Jack likes this." He growled. He held the kinfe up over his head preparing to
plunge it into me but there was a knock on the door.  
"Holly?" Jack's voice came from outside. "I can't get in!" J.R. smiled grimly.  
"on second thought...he can watch." he walked towards the door and I waited
until he was gone from sight, his footsteps echoing down the stairs. I jumped
up and ripped the tape off my mouth, running to the window,  
"Jack! Run!" My muffled scream sounded and as he looked up at me the door
swung open and he was pulled inside. I ran to the top of the stairs. Overcome
with surprise Jack frowned at Ryan and opened his mouth but J.R. picked up an
umbrella by the door and swiftly hit him across the head, knocking him to the
ground. I screamed at him and ran to the bathroom across the hall. I heard
footsteps pursue me up the stairs and I slammed and locked the door. He
started beating on it furiously. I ran to the small window and contemplated
what I would do. Thinking quickly I opened the window and ripped off a peice
of my shirt, leaving it hanging on the window ledge. Bushes would cusion the
blow, I figured but instead I ran to the cabinets under the sink and squeezed
myself in them as quietly as possible and shut the door. The bathroom door
burst open and heavy footsteps sounded on the floor. I pushed the door open a
crack and peeked out. He looked down out the window and turned resolutely and
walked out of the bathroom. I waited for about a minute until I heard the
footsteps die away and crept out of the cabinet. Running out of the bathroom I
was knocked to the ground by an arm that appeared in front of me. I looked up
to see Ryan standing triumphantly over me.  
"I knew I smelled you in there." He smiled and leaned down over me.  
"You sick freak."  
"Seemed to do you just fine." I punched him across the face but it used up a
lot of my energy and soon he had me pinned, sitting on top.  
"Joeseph Ryan don't do this. This is exactly how mom and dad died." Jack stood
in front of us.  
"I dont care how they died. They weren't our parents. They didn't raise us."  
"You're right. I did."  
"You're as much a father to me as Holly was a girlfriend." I slapped him. He
pinned my arms down and leaned down to lick me on the face.  
"Get off of me you slimebag." I spat at him with disdain.  
"You want to know how our parents died, huh Holly?" He licked his lips. I
glared at him. "Go on Jack, tell her how you killed our parents." Jack turned
pale and leaned against the wall. "Do it!" He yelled at Jack.  
"My mother and father were horribly addicted to cocaine... and mixed with
alcohol, that made them nasty people. I walked in one night when I was about
16 to find my father strangling my mom on the kitchen counter. I was tired of
it so I took out his shotgun, and shot him once in the head. Soon after than
my mom commited suicide."  
"You see Holly, I started doing that stuff when I was young, learning from my
parents. I got clean a couple of years ago but you showed me to hide my pain
again." He smiled wickedly. Tears poured from my eyes.  
"No Ryan, please don't-"  
"Don't what Holl? Make you feel bad?"  
"It's your choice to abuse them, not mine." He hit me across the face. I
looked to Jack where he had seemed now to be off in his own world, staring at
his hands like he was seeing them for the first time.  
"Jack..." I whispered. He looked at me and back down again. "Please don't
listen to him, he's manipulating you."  
"You know all about manipulation don't you Holly?" Ryan said, staring down at
me. "Leave with me. We can walk out of this house right now, leave Jack to his
misery and come away with me." I looked at him hard.  
"Hell no. I wouldn't leave with an alcoholic crack addict if someone paid me."
I said forcefully. He hit me again.  
"The only reason I've resorted to these ways is because of you. We can leave
all this behind. Start fresh. Come with me." I looked at Jack, he was staring
back at me.  
"Will you leave Jack alone forever and stop torturing him about your parents?"
I whispered. Jack sprang up.  
"No Holly."  
"Yes I will." J.R. nodded vigourously. I looked at Jack with tears still
falling.  
"Dont leave me Holly."  
"Jack, your past will be erased and you can start over with someone else.
That's what I want for you, to be happy."  
"I can't be happy without you."  
"Of course you can." I whispered, we both got the message, our cheating had
led us to believe it was possible. He was silent.  
"I'll go." I said, almost not audibly. Ryan pulled me up and started to lead
me out.  
"No you won't." Jack said as he stepped in our path. He raised a gun and
leveled it with J.R.'s head.  
"Jack. You looking to wipe out all of your family members?"  
"Only the ones that need to be." He growled. Quickly he pointed the gun
downward and shot J.R.'s leg. Ryan screamed and crumpled to the ground.  
"You shot my leg you-" he groaned and grabbed his leg to stop the blood.
Suddenly sirens sounded outside our house and there was a knock on the door. I
sprinted down the stairs and threw open the door. A police officer was
standing there.  
"Officer! Thank God." I breathed.  
"There has been some complaints from the neighbors. They claimed they heard
screaming and shouting coming from inside the house." he said sternly.  
"There has been in fact, screaming and shouting."  
"Is there a problem?"  
"Yes. There is." I led him inside and he called for an ambluance. Ryan had
tried to escape but his leg hurt too much. I looked at Jack and bit my lip. He
came over and hugged me.  
"You know, you did the right thing, with your parents and J.R. You were
protecting the people you loved." I looked up at him and he nodded.  
"Yeah, I know." He smiled at me.  
  
Ryan was sentanced to prison for breaking and entering, assult and two counts
of attempted murder after he got out of the hospital. I went to visit him. He
didn't look at me or talk to me, he just stared straight ahead holding the
phone to his ear.  
"Look at me." I said after a moments silence. "Look at me!" I cried his eyes
slowly turned towards mine.  
"Time's up!" The guard cried.  
"But I've only been here for five minutes!" I protested  
"I know. Thats it." I looked back at Ryan and his eyes seemed to dance with
trickery. He opened his mouth  
"Death is a gift." he said.  
That night, he hung himself in his jail cell.  
  
Jack walked in the door looking tired and unhappy. He took off his vest and
sat down on a chair, the police must've reached him at headquarters and
already told him the news. He rested his elbows on his knees, bent down and
put his face in his hands.  
"Oh God Jack, I'm so sorry." I said kneeling in front of him. He looked up at
me and swallowed hard. I felt tears well up inside of me and that burning in
my nose I get every time I'm about to cry. "It was all my fault." He shook his
head.  
"no it was mine, I was supposed to protect him."  
"It wasn't your fault Jack." I said forcefully and Jack smiled a weak smile at
me.  
"Fran and Greg are moving in."  
"When?"  
"Tommorrow."  
"Jack."  
"yeah?"  
"I love you more than I ever thought I could love anything or anyone. The
thought of you hurting, physically pains me inside and I never want to leave
your side."  
"I never want you to leave my side. Bridgette was just a momentary
weakness..." I put my finger to his lips.  
"Shhhhhh." I whispered and took his hand. He followed me upstairs. I kissed
him in the dark coolness of our room and never felt more overcome with love
and pleasure in my whole life. We tenderly kissed each other and slowly made
pure untouchable love.  
I woke up feeling whole and full of life. Looking over and expecting to see
Jack's ruffled hair I beheld nothing but a peice of paper.  
Gone to get Fran and Greg.  
Be back soon.  
I love you.  
-J  
  
I smiled slowly and rolled over. The phone rang next to my bed. I picked it
up.  
"Hello?"  
"Holly!" I heard Jack's voice frantic on the other line.  
"Jack?"  
"Listen to me. Get out of the house. Now."  
"What?" I frowned "Why?"  
"Bomb. GO NOW!" I heard the click on the other end of the line. Getting up, I
grabbed some clothes and sprinted out of the house. It stood serenly in the
sun and then it exploded and I was thrown back with a gust of wind and fire. I
hit the ground hard and covered my head with my clothes as debris went flying
by. I stood up after it had settled down and noticed I was standing in my
underwear as my neighbors came out to check what the heck was going on. I
quickly pulled on my clothes and saw Jack's car pull up. He was alone. He got
out and ran to me.  
"Fran and Greg?" He exhaled.  
"Bomb."  
"They're dead?" I cried with horror settling in my system.  
"NO, their appartment was destroyed by a bomb and they've not been found. They
could be dead or gone."  
"Who was it?"  
" One of Gavin's accomplices, and Gavin happens to be Fox's brother."  
"Gavin is my half brother? I thought he was dead."  
"Afraid so. And he is."  
"How many family members does Fox have? Can't he just leave me alone?" I
shrieked, looking towards the sky.  
"Listen to me, there is a high ranking mole in the UDCU. Thats how the capure
of the unit was syncronized. I saw an open computer with everything on it.
thats how I knew to try and get you and Fran out."  
"You went to the office today?"  
"Yeah. I wanted to catch up with your dad and try to smooth things over with
him but I never got the chance. We have to inform him of the mole." We ran to
his car and sped off.  
"Drop me off in the front there." I said to Jack. He did. I ran into my
father's office, and screamed. My dad was sitting at his desk, but there was
blood everywhere and bullets in his body.  
"DAD!" I cried, running over to him. He was already dead. "no!"  
"Oh yes." I turned and saw a man older than my father standing near the
window.  
"You murder." I spat.  
"I shot him outside so no one could hear and dragged him in here. I was quite
civil. Do you know who I am?" he said  
"I don't want to." Tears stained my cheeks.  
"Oh, but you do. You've already killed both my sons, took one of them as your
our and killed my second wife."  
"You're Fox's father."  
"You're smarter than you look." he glared. "And now, you've succeded in
killing my best worker." I glared at him. And slowly the realization dawned on
me.  
"Ryan worked for you?" I exclaimed with horror.  
"Yes, yes he did. He was like a son to me. His first assignment...you. But he
told me he loved you and he couldn't do it, however; he knew the consequences
for not finnishing an assignment. So he did a little recon." He smiled evily.
"and then he couldn't kill you sober, so he drank and did his stuff so he
wouldn't have to realize what he was doing. But he got sloppy...didn't tie you
up, didn't think it through. So you and you're little Jack escaped unscathed.
I guess if you want something done you have to do it yourself." He raised a
gun towards me. "Oh, don't worry missy, I wont kill you. I want you to suffer
as mush as possible, like I have." Slowly I realized what he was saying, but
it was too late. He fired a couple of times as I turned to look at Jack, who
had just walked through the doorway. He fell to the ground, bleeding from his
abdomen.  
"Oh God no. No No NO!" I screamed at the top of my lungs. I looked at the old
man who had the gun raised to his head as he smiled.  
"Holly, I'm sure you've been told...death is a gift." And he shot himself as
people came running towards my fathers door.  
"Holly." Jack grimaced.  
"No no no... baby you've been shot before." but I knew, never as much as this
at one time. I looked at the bullets that riddled his chest. "Where was your
vest?" Inside the blown up house, with my vest...duh.  
"I've only loved one...you." he said with effort.  
"No God no, baby. Please stay with me. Look at me. God no. Jack, baby, look at
me. Look at me. That's right. Just keep looking at me, okay? Okay? yes, that's
right. You're gonna be fine. Dont close you're eyes. Listen to my voice baby.
Jack?" I felt cold dread seize my body and shake me with fear. "JACK!" His
eyes started to close. "Oh God, No. JACK! JACK!" His head rolled to one side
and I felt his heart beat stop. "JACK!" I was convulsed up a wave of nausea
that I fought down.  
I closed my eyes and buried my face in his neck.  
"No problem, and hey, give him one of your mean high kicks." I saw Jacks
smiling face and brigth green eyes the first time we met.  
"Do you like him?" My sister asked. I snorted. "Jack? No."  
"YOU DIDN"T BREAK UP WITH YOUR SISTER?" he looked so tired and spent. "I love
you.".  
"Holly baby please wake up...I love you."  
I kissed him, but Boone and I were engaged! I saw him a little while after
Boone's death. "No. I know now. We're meant to be together."  
Biological father: Jack Paler.  
I kissed him! I kissed Jack!  
I opened my eyes, stopping the memories and kissed him one last time, his lips
were cold. The pain was too much, my head hurt. Suddenly I stood up and felt
odly numb. People around me were staring. They parted and let me walk away,
covered in my husbands blood.  
  
I walked into the warehouse at the old loading dock to be greeted by my men.
My hair was pulled back and I was wearing my gear and black pants.  
"Tell me what's going down today boys." I said shortly, walking into the space
I called my office.  
"Well, there's a deal down at the dock, new shipments from cuba and we have
the mayor's daughter as hostage to blackmail him."  
"Good. Bring the new one in." I heard my head man, Dorian talking to him.  
"Now," he said in his Italian accent "Only speak when spoken to, the boss
doesn't take no crap." He led in the guy. I analyzed him. I had been doing
this for about five years, I knew what a good gunman looked like. He was short
with blak hair, arm muscles pretty big and big hands. Perfect. I thought. He
stood silently and I could tell he felt awkward.  
"Come here." I said. He immediately came foward. "Hands." I demanded reaching
out my hands towards him. He looked side to side for a second then placed his
hands in mine. I inspected them for a minute, felt his claises, look for a
ring. There was none. I let go of his hands, inspected his physique for a few
more moments and made a shooing motion with my hand. He hurridly left.  
"Dorian." I called  
"yes boss?" He said quickly entering the room.  
"Keep him. Sharpshooter." I said. "Bring in the hostage." He nodded and left
quickly. Soon after a young teenage girl was forced into the room and strapped
to the chair across from my desk.  
"My father-" she glared at me  
"Shhhhhh." I cut her off. "I was like you once. That fire in your eyes is
familiar to me. Soon, it will be extinguished." I said in a matter-of-fact
way. I carefully put on each of my rings. "You dont tell me what I want,
you'll pay the consequences. Now listen. If you do what you're told, you'll
wake up in front of your house a few days from now forgetting all of this. If
you dont, you will never see your father again."  
"You'll die in prison!" She cried.  
"Honey," I grabbed her face with my manicured nails "I have nothing to lose."  
"What do you want?"  
"Where is your father's personal warehouse?"  
"I dont know."  
"Fine, call him." I thrust a phone under her nose. She dialed the number.  
"Hi, yeah, daddy it's me. No, I'm fine. I need to know where your warehouse
is."  
"tell him to keep it unlocked tonight."  
"ok. can you keep it unlocked tonight? They wont hurt me if you do." She
paused and looked at me. "Promise?"  
"Promise." I said. Everyone knew I kept my promises.  
  
I walked in front of my group of Dorian, Kent and Ackers. We were going to
make a transaction in a room by the docks. A guard was standing out front. I
didn't recognize him.  
"you new here huh?" I asked.  
"Yes, I'm afraid you can't enter or I will have to take some drastic
measures." he said, trying to intimidate.  
"I've been stabbed, shot and killed. Don't even try to intimidate me." I said,
walking towards the door. The guy tried to punch me but I ducked came up with
a hit, hitting him on his left jaw and knocking him clean out. "Drain him." I
said to Dorian, which was our code for drugging him so he wouldn't remember
what had taken place. The drug was comfiscated by our team a few years ago for
a science lab we broke into and was the only thing keeping us out of jail. I
entered and saw an old companion. We settled the deal.  
  
I walked into my huge house aquired by illegal means and I could feel a shadow
of a smile playing on my lips. The UDCU had been after me for years, never
pinning anything on me. I'll always remember killing one of my last links to
Jack, Bridgette. She was a good target. I looked over at Tom, my newest toy.
He smiled at me sinisterly and I took him upstairs to my bedroom. I looked at
Rife, whom had been there since the night before.  
"Melania?" He said to me. I threw him a sideways glance. he gave me a confused
look.  
"Will you excuse us?" I said to him. He got up and left the bedroom. I looked
back to Tom.  
"Who was he?" Tom gave me a questioning look.  
"Who you'll be tommorrow." I said quietly.  
"Huh?"  
"Nothing, he's nobody." I went into my closet and called behind my shoulder.
"Let me get changed for a sec." I grabbed on of the top boxes in my closet, I
always put away my lingerie in the daytime. I grabbed one that I hadn't used
in a while and a peice of photocopied paper fluttered down to the floor in
front of me. I picked it up, knowing what it was. I carefully looked at it,
knowing the authentic was somewhere else, along with who it belonged to.  
Birth Certificate For Jack Ryan Paler: Born September 17th 2005 at Chalotte
County Hospital.  
I quickly hid the piece of paper. I had picked a good couple, the woman small
and delicate, the man looked like a football fan who liked to grill for the
fourth of July. I gave them specific instrutions to have my son keep his name,
but never to look for me. Melania Shaw. Holly Paler. I pulled out the corset
and lingerie set and pushed past thoughts out of my head.  
I was laying in bed with Tom, who was fast asleep. I kinda like this one. I
thought darkly. I already had two boys living in the house. Cody and Louis,
the latter whom I called Lou. I mainly paid for everything, Cody was a bit
surprised when he found out Lou was going to move in also but after a while
they got used to sharing me with other men and I clearly stated to them the
dangers of living with me. I heard the door downstairs close. There goes Rife.
I snorted. My house had the most advanced sercurity system though, and I
wasn't worried about it. Though I seldom worried about anything. As a matter
of fact the only worry I felt was when I thought of my son. I sometimes had
trouble sleeping, dreams of Jack played in my head almost every night. Then I
would wake up and feel empty again. I looked at Tom again and decided not to
keep him. I turned over and went to my bar to pour myself a drink. A figure
popped up behind my bar. It was a small figure, like one of a teenager. I
turned on a lamp. I saw the face of a teenage boy looking back at me.  
"How'd you get in here kid?" I said bluntly.  
"I followed you home. I'm supposed to blow this." He said, looking pale and
showing me a bomb around his neck.  
"Come on," I said slowly. "You're too young to die, whoever sent you here is a
coward."  
"I have no where else to go." I looked at him for a second.  
"Come and work for me."  
"Seriously? I'd love to." I looked for signs of sarcasm.  
"Obvioiusly my reputation proceeds me." I said drinking my drink slowly.  
"I know you'll keep me safe for a little while." he said sincerely.  
"okay, done," I said shaking his hand briefly. he took off the bomb and gave
it to me. "did you see the code?"  
"No I wouldn't dare follow you that close." I looked at him closely and then
hit him hard with the butt of my gun. he crumpled. I dragged him to my
bathroom, gagged him, tied him and dumped him in the tub. I went back to bed.  
  
"Boss we got your man." I almost smiled.  
"This is my day off but...I'll be there soon." they got one of the politicians
of the city in my office. I had been tracking this guy for ages and he had
come close to ruining my buisness once. I walked in the office, throwing my
coat at Kent. Dorian came up to me.  
"Threats are no use. Make this one a Polyanna." he nodded and motioned for
Ackers to bring him in.  
"You've cause me a lot of trouble sir." I said. "What to you have to say for
yourself."  
"I have a family...please. I was only doing the right thing."  
"Life is pain Mr. Morris. Death, is a gift." I said and pointed the gun at his
head.  
"Please!" For a minute he looked like my father and I halted. The guys looked
at each other. And then I pulled the trigger.  
They found him downstream from the shipping dock a few days later, no prints,
no bullet, no sign of stuggle. They dissmissed the case and looked to finding
other criminals.  
  
I walked home, and saw a cop waiting outside my home. He was striking, with
dark brown eyes and tuffled black hair.  
"Hello. My name is officer Norings."  
"You have a first name officer?"  
"Yes I do. Mind if I ask you a few questions?" he smiled.  
"Actually yes I do. Goodnight." I turned to walk inside.  
"That was just courtesy but I can see you're not prone to that Ms. Shaw." He
said in the same tone. "Answer the questions anyways."  
"Ok shoot."  
"Where were you on the night of July 22nd?"  
"In Rio, Brazil." He gave me a suspicious look.  
"Are you serious?"  
"If I'm correct Mr. Norings you told me to answer the question, not to answer
it truthfully." I shot him a glance and looked back towards my house as I
heard his chuckle behind me.  
"Being difficult is an offense Ms. Shaw."  
"Is following directions?"  
"No of course not."  
"Well, Mr. Norings, that was exactly what I was doing." He smiled at me again.
He looked at the ground, biting his lower lip and then looked back at my eyes.  
"Call me Tate."  
"I was here, with my boys." I said seriously.  
"Can they support that?"  
"Yes." I said smugly.  
"Can you show physical evidence of justification?"  
"Now, Mr. Norings...here I was thinking that was your job." I said with a hint
of a smile.  
"It's yours if you want to stay out of the jailhouse Ms. Shaw."  
"Call me Melania."  
"Do you have evidence?"  
"I think the correct question is if you, in fact have the correct means to
hold me in custody of any worng doing Officer Norings. Or if you're just
bluffing your way into getting off early tonight."  
"Your prints on the body of Senator Morris." I looked at him carefully.  
"You're bluffing." I said accusingly. He leaned against his car.  
"And what if I am?"  
"Goodnight Officer Norings." I said and turned towards my house. He grabbed my
arm. I spun to face him. He look at me for a second, his extremely dark eyes
penetrating. " Can I help you?"  
"Actually you can, but I doubt you'll be willing."  
"Well, then I bid you adieu." I said quickly.  
"What's the rush Melania?" He said, smiling.  
"Actually," I said, leaning close "I have a body to dispose of." He laughed.
His laugh was warm and sincere.  
"Well, in that case..."  
"Officer Norings, I pray thee, tell me what thou wisht of me."  
"Well if I said that, I'd be fired, I'm on duty." I looked at him carefully.
This I could use to my advantage.  
"Well then, looks as if you have a dilema. Tell you what, I'll clear that up
for you." I pulled out a peice of paper and pen, and handed him my number.
"Call me and tell me when you're not." He smiled. "Goodnight officer."  
"Goodnight miss."  
Cody was sitting on the couch in our living room with some other guys watching
a sports game.  
"Cody." I said over the shouting.  
"Melania!" He rushed over and kissed me.  
"I was here the night of July 22nd and if anyone asks you for evidence than
tell him you don't think he'll want it."  
"Okay. Are you going to bed?"  
"No."  
"I kicked that Tom guy out and found a teen tied up in your bathtub."  
"you let him out?"  
"Of course not."  
"Good boy." I said, licking my lips. He stared at me for a sec. and turned
around.  
"Hey guys! You're gonna hve to go soon." I almost smiled as I walked up to my
room. I looked at the kid in the tub. He was asleep, I reahced down and pulled
off the gag from his mouth and he came awake with a start.  
"Woah! Oh hi." I looked at him for a while.  
"This is what's going to happen kid." I told him of my plans to eliminate some
competition and he looked appauled.  
"No! I wont be bait."  
"Actually you will."  
"But-" I could see he was struggling with feelings.  
"Listen kid I'm feeling particularly nice tonight for no particular reason but
if I say you will, you will. Think of it this way, if I kicked you out, would
they let you come back to them anyways?" He seemed to be thinking for a
moment.  
"No."  
"That's what I thought."  
"Melania?" I heard Cody's voice in the bedroom.  
"Don't come out." I said to the kid and walked into the bedroom.  
  
The next day I took the kid with me to work but made sure he hid in the trunk
of my car. I forced him into the building as Micca took my coat and told
Dorian of my plan. He said it was good and I gave him a look so he left. I
talked to some of my favorite dealers in China and took out some vodka for
myself.  
"You have a visitor, he said he wants to discuss a trade for the kid."
Dorian's head appeared at my door.  
"Bring him in and lock the door behind him." A nice looking man in about his
twenties walked in and sat down.  
"Where is my brother?"  
"You work for Kane is that right?" Kane was one of my biggest rivals in the
buisness.  
"Correct."  
"You came here alone?"  
"I love my brother." I laughed. But it wasn't a nice sounding laugh, it never
was. I walked to my window and pulled down the blinds. The only thing in my
office was my desk, which had a computer and phone sitting on it. the white
walls were bare and all my equipment was in my closet. I pulled out a rope and
one of my favorite instruments and grabbed my gun. He wasn't watching me. It
was easier when they didn't. I hit him with the but of my gun quickly,
disorienting him as I tied him to the chair. I pulled out my instrument. It
was one of my own creations, a metal pole about three feet long and eaisly fit
in the palm of my hand. It had a sharp end on one side and a blunt one on the
other. It had attachable swivel on options for both ends but now that was what
I had on it. I slowly stuck the sharp end in his thigh and he screamed in
pain.  
"What kind of trade did you have in mind?"  
"I wanted to trade my brother for one of our hostages...a school teacher who
was caught snooping around."  
"Not interested. Tell me where the warehouse is."  
"No." I dug in the sharp end a bit more. He screamed. I took it out and took
off his shoes.  
"tell."  
"No." I plunged the sharp end into the skin between his toes, now he was
screaming and crying. Screaming very loud. I put tape on his mouth. and bent
towards his face.  
"Shhhhhh. They'll hear you." I whispered in his ear as tears streamed down his
face. "You're a handsome young man." I said, biting his ear. "when you're
ready to talk, just start nodding your head.  
  
I walked out of my office, the young man looking back at me. I looked at
Dorian let him and his brother go. The young boy looked at me with malice in
his eyes, he had been forced to listen to his brother's screams under my
command.  
"They'll kill us!" He yelled. "Slowly and painfully!" He stood up and looked
at me.  
"Fine. I'll be nice." I pulled out my gun and shot him in the chest. His older
brother screamed again and I looked at Dorian. "Send the young one to our lab
and bury him near warehouse 56." we both looked towards my room. "As for the
older one, let him go. Kent'll catch him." I put on one of my rings and walked
into our version of a tourture room to deal with some other hostages. After a
little while a big guy with practically no neck came in. I recognized him
immediately.  
"Rocky." I greeted him cordially.  
"Melania. I was wonder if my stuff came in yet."  
"I was wondering if you had my money yet."  
"Not yet but I promise I will Melania."  
"Oh I would hate to lose a good customer like you Rock."  
"Listen, the feds are breathing down my neck about this one. It's a big load
Melania."  
"I know, I'm transferring it."  
"Just get the feds out of the banks. You know how well I rob."  
"Its your job to do that."  
"Listen, create a diversion and I'll give you a little bonus." He smiled. I
thought for a minute.  
"You know my rules. If you don't give me what's promised..." I whipped out my
gun and put it on his forehead. "Boom!"  
"I get it."  
"Fine. I agree, a diversion with the bonus." I said and nodded. We shook hands
making the deal complete. He left and Dorian came to stand by my side, where
he usually was.  
"How you gonna do that?"  
"Let's just say I have a friend on the force."  
"You think he'll help you?"  
"If I help him." He gave me a queer look and I snapped, "get back to work." he
gave me a shrug and disappeared.  
  
A few days later my phone rang. I was jogging in the park as part of my
Saturday activities. I knew who it was, not that my phone rang seldom but he
hadn't called in about a week after our incounter and I knew he was that kinda
guy.  
"Hello Officer."  
"Melania."  
"I thought you'd never call."  
"I think you're bluffing. You knew perfectly well I would."  
"I underestimated you Mr. Norings."  
"As usual."  
"Did you call for a particular reason?"  
"Yes. I'm not on duty."  
"So you think you could coax answers out of me that way? Stick to the
uniform."  
"No, that's not it, but the uniform does make me look good, I'll give you
that. Makes me look like a people's man."  
"And what does this good looking people's man possibly want with me?" I said
innocently.  
"Dinner."  
"I never guessed you'd be into cannibalism Mr. Norings but, it can happen to
anyone."  
"You really aren't an easy person to ask out Ms. Shaw."  
"What are you gonna do about it?"  
"Put you in handcuffs." I smiled a little, but it felt weird so I quickly
wiped it off my face.  
"Oh, sounds terribly dreadful."  
"It's not that bad."  
"Pick me up at my house since you seem to know where it is, tonight at six.
Goodbye Officer Norings." I hung up the phone.
