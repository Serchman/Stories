The moonlight filtered through the grime covered windows of the second floor
apartment.  
**In** the otherwise darkened room its rays illuminated the badly painted panels of the bedroom door.  
From within the room came the low sobbing of a woman, and the even lower
persistent murmurings of a man's gruff voice.  
By pressing my ear close to the panel I could barely hear his words.  
"Where do you keep your money hidden?"  
The woman's voice rose **in** a wail of fear.  
"I keep telling you, I don't have any money to hide.  
What little I do have is **in** my purse, there, on the bureau."  
The sound of heavy footsteps crossing the room where enough to make me
withdraw from my listening post, and hide behind the sofa.  
The door partially opened, and then it was slammed shut once more.  
  
I'd let myself **in** quietly to my Aunt's house for she often slept **in**
the early evening after finishing work.  
I'd wait until she woke and then I'd make tea for us both.  
She liked me to visit, but my visits were always an excuse to get a few quid
off her to take my current girlfriend to the cinema.  
I was surprised to hear the sound of voices, that is until I heard the
conversation that was taking place **in** the bedroom.  
  
Since Uncle Isaac died she had ran the pawnbroker's business alone, and she
was indeed a very rich woman, although living as she did **in** this tiny
apartment, one could be forgiven for thinking she was a lonely old widow.  
Like Uncle Isaac, Auntie didn't trust banks, and so all of her wealth was
hidden within the apartment.  
I knew where it was hidden because I had seen her hiding place **in** the
bedroom through the wardrobe mirror one time that she had left the door
slightly ajar.  
The intruders voice increased **in** intensity and the sound of a slap could
be clearly heard through the closed door.  
  
My Aunt was crying now and begging the intruder to go.  
Again and again the sound of the slap resounded around the apartment, and
then, complete silence.  
I kept low, hidden behind the sofa. the sound of frantic searching now took
prominence, as drawers and cupboards were rifled through.  
The bedroom door opened and the man went into the kitchen.  
  
Peering around the side of the sofa I could see him opening drawers and
cupboards.  
He was growing more impatient by the moment, until finally, with a curse, he
left the apartment.  
Having given him time to clear the building I walked into my Aunt's bedroom.
She was sprawled on the bed, quite obviously dead.  
She may have looked frail, but she was even frailer than she looked, and
obviously her heart couldn't stand the assault that she had suffered.  
  
Opening the wardrobe I removed the false base and withdrew the money satchel
that was hidden there.  
Inside was **in** excess of six hundred and forty thousand pounds, along with
some pretty expensive looking jewellery.  
Carefully replacing the false base I silently left the apartment.  
No-one saw or heard me as I made my way home.  
  
**In** my bedroom I secreted my hoard **in** a similar place to my Aunt's false wardrobe base.  
I was more than sure that no-one could ever find it there.  
Jumping onto my motor-cycle I returned to my Aunt's apartment, this time
making plenty of noise and shouting "Hello" to one or two of the neighbours.  
Hurrying into her apartment I quickly phoned the police on my mobile and
informed them about my finding my Aunt dead.  
  
They arrived quickly, and I sat on the sofa crying.  
The Medical Officer arrived and he reported that my Aunt had died as the
result of a beating.  
The police were most suspicious of me at first, but a neighbour had seen a
well-known villain leaving Aunt's apartment earlier.  
The timing coincided with her time of death, and so the police released me and
went **in** search of this villain.  
He was quickly caught, and under extreme questioning confessed all.  
He was subsequently jailed for twenty years.  
  
Me? I'm living **in** **Marbella** now.
