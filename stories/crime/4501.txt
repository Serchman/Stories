The publics general conception of a serial killer is that of their being a
maniac, when in fact nothing could be further from the truth.  
Take me for instance.  
I am a completely rational person, and I am well aware of the consequences of
my actions, and more importantly, the penalties that I face if caught.  
No my friend, it isn't as clear cut as it appears on the surface.  
I've been killing women regularly for many years, and yet the police have not
one iota in regard to my identity, because I plan my killings with a minute
attention to detail.  
Sometimes I take weeks in choosing my victim.  
Then I will familiarise myself with their daily routine for many more weeks
before choosing the time and place to strike.  
I never reject any possiblity of error, no matter how small.  
I never kill when there is the slightest possibility of my being suspected or
interrupted.  
By far my favourite victim is one who goes out every weekend with her friends
and likes to drink.  
Drink makes the victim so much easier to overpower.  
I have no preference regarding nationality, age, or height, but they must be
considered beautiful.  
Beautiful girls or women are invariably arrogant, and it is their arrogance
which first attracts my attention.  
I revel in erasing the arrogance from their person, especially when they
awaken to find themselves stripped, bound and gagged.  
Oh yes, they certainly lose their air of arrogance then!  
The look in their eyes when they realise that they are completely helpless.  
That their beauty and wealth play no part in their bargaining position.  
That I, and I alone will be the decision maker as to whether they should live
or die.  
I know for a certainty that they are about to die, but they, they with their
unshakable arrogance, are convined that they can make me change my mind. More
fool them.  
I sit before them and marvel at their attempts to persuade me to let them go
... their assurances that they will tell no-one as to what has taken place
here, and so on and so forth.  
Don't they know how many, many times I have listened to the inane pleadings of
my previous victims?  
Don't they ever read what I and my kind do to people like them?  
No, their pleadings will in no way weaken my resolve to kill them.  
I have honed my craft over many years, and you can be assured that most of the
many missing women's pictures that are displayed in your local constabulary
are not those of missing women, but of dead women.  
I know exactly what I am, and why I do what I do.  
If the police were just half as good as the public think they are I would have
been caught many times, but they are not, so I remain free to go on my merry
way.  
Well, I must be going.  
I've a meeting with a certain high-stepping haughty secretary that I've been
planning for weeks.

Bye.
