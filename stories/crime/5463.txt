**** Intro:** Part 2 of 2 Liam and Eddie from "The Buy". The early days 

* * *

The next morning I stuffed a thou into the wallet and fedexed it to her. Then
waited two days before going back to the club. It was Wednesday night and a
little busier. I saw Marci but she studiously ignored me. In fact all the
girls were studiously ignoring me. I sat at a table and noticed the blond that
did the evening gown bit was circulating. I had the waitress send her over.
“So ‘The Dick of Steel' is still with us, and she sat down.” You betcha’. I'm
on a 10 day junket and I still have 4 days left to party!" The waitress
brought her drink. We had a short, somewhat desultory conversation, and then
the next set began. She got up on the table and stripped. When it was over I
gave her my regular $10 tip. She never even thanked me. I stayed at the table
and had another beer. Pretty soon I saw Marci alone, cruising. I sent a
waitress scurrying to get her. She came over to me and sat down smiling her
regular customer smile “are you crazy! You want to get us killed? "  
"Why" I answered, with my regular customer smile ”I'm just a lovable hayseed.
Have you gotten any vibes otherwise?”  
"No, but just the same. "  
"Look, you're driving me crazy. I need to see you."  
"Well, you have my address. I can't stop you. Incidentally, thanks for the
money."  
"No, I'm not that kind of a guy. If you don't want to see me, I'll drop it"  
She looked at me strangely then the next set began, and she got up on the
table and stripped. I tipped her ten when it was over. As she got down she
said “I get off at two. Give me some time. Come by around three."

  
She lived in a six story apartment house. A buzzer, no doorman. It was on a
wide, brightly lit avenue. I arrived around one, and found a parking place
that allowed me to watch her entranceway. A little after two traffic started
picking up. It must have been shift change at the casinos. A guy went in
around twenty after using a key. She arrived by herself at two thirty. Then
another guy about ten of three. Neither of the guys looked threatening. I
headed for the entranceway at three, and rang her bell. I was wearing my Mag
in a shoulder holster.  
I heard " Who is it?' on the intercom.  
"The Dick of Steel“ She buzzed me in. Her apartment was on the third floor.
There was no one in the lobby. When the elevator approached the third floor, I
took out my gun and held it at my side. When the elevator stopped, I peeked
out. No one around. I went to her door and knocked, standing aside holding the
gun straight up beside my head. She opened the door with a big smile. I pushed
quickly past her.  
“Oh my God, you're going to kill me!” She was wearing rather plain, light
green two piece cotton pajamas. She still looked great.  
"Shut the fuck up.“  
I checked all the rooms, closets, even under the beds. She followed behind me.
It was a big airy apartment. Two bedrooms, a large living room, a small
kitchen and a dining alcove.  
"I had to be sure you weren't setting me up."  
"I understand. But you scared the hell out of me. Would you like a drink?"

"Sure, beer"  
She went to the fridge a came back with two Coronas. We sat across from each
other at a small square dining table.  
"Was he you're boyfriend? "  
"God no. I was just his girl du jour. He was a nasty bastard. If he wanted to
sleep with you, you slept with him. If he wanted to fuck you up the ass, you
bent over and spread your cheeks. All the girls were terrified of him."  
"Do you get the feeling they might be looking at you as being involved"  
“No, none at all. I’m just a cipher there. They think this is a mob hit, and
everyone’s trying to figure out who's behind it. I understand that a lot of
different families have operations here. He was tied in with some people in
NY, and I hear they're in an uproar. But other than that no one gives a shit.
In fact I get the idea there's a feeling of relief. I think they were going to
try and get him out of town anyway. The club owners were pissed. He was
scaring away customers, and some of the best girls left. And it wasn't just
the clubs, he was making a pain in the ass of himself all over town."  
"How about me? Anyone looking at me?"  
"God no" she laughed "you're just considered a tedious, corny cheapskate. A
complete nobody. I assume that's just a clever disguise. Or at least I said a
little prayer before you arrived that it was just a clever disguise."  
We finished our beers. She said "Look, I'm really beat. I need sleep. I
promise you we'll have a good time in the morning, OK?"  
I was devastated, and probably looked it.  
"You want me to sleep in the extra bedroom?"  
"No silly. Hop in bed with me. I like to sleep with a man beside me.“  
I stripped and we got into bed. I put my arm around her. She snuggled against
me and encircled my erect penis with a tight fist. About 5 seconds later she
was fast asleep, snoring loudly. It was agonizing, lying there with her warm
body pressed against me. I couldn't sleep. I finally got up, got dressed and
laid on top of the bed in the extra bedroom, eventually going to a sleep.  
  
She was drinking coffee, still in her pajamas when I awoke and came out of the
bedroom. "What the hell were you doing in there?" she was laughing.  
"I was too horny to go to sleep next to you "  
"Good. I have you primed! Want some scrambled eggs?'  
“Yeah, I want to take a shower first"  
“Scrub hard! I want you good and clean. There’s a fresh towel in there and
don't get dressed."  
I came out of the bathroom, with the towel wrapped around me. She looked me
over, tat tense precoital grin, then scrambled us some eggs. We ate in the
alcove facing each other across the table. When we were done she stacked the
dishes in the sink. “Wait here “ she said and headed back to her bedroom. She
returned with a jewelry box, opened it on the table and laid out two neat
lines of powder.  
She had a straw and snorted her line and passed me the straw. I'd never done
coke. In fact, despite my business, I was never into drugs much. I smoked pot
a few times, and took speed once. Well, I'm in the fast lane now. I followed
her example and snorted it up. I started to feel the rush quickly. And what a
rush it turned into. She stood and walked over, put an arm around me and sat
on my lap. I cupped her breast in my hand. kneading it.  
"OK Dick of Steel, just what kind of kinky stuff are you into?"  
Well, as it happens, I'd never done much more than the old in and out, and
damn little of that unfortunately.  
"Honey, I'm all into pleasing the ladies. You just let me know what turns you
on."  
She smirked. I think she saw through me. "You're such a sweetie" She got off
my lap, took off her pajama bottoms, and leaned against the edge of the table
facing me. "Scoot on over here lover!”  
I felt her hands on the back of my head, then her pussy hairs ticking my nose
and her warm thighs pressing against my ears. God she had strong legs, I was
afraid she'd crush my skull. Dancer’s legs.  
  
The next two days were idyllic. I never realized the wide variety of sexual
expression that existed. Our safe word was ‘furnace’. Each day she would also
work on her routine for the club. I was her advisor. She was interested in the
typical horny male reaction to the changes she was contemplating. She was
serious about it.

And she was a serious about dancing. She came from a comfortable middle class
background in Minneapolis. Her father, Roger Thorsten, was a Quality Control
Engineer at Pillsbury.

"and my mother was an Arts freak" she told me “she did water colors, acted in
the Little Theater and attended every Cultural Event that came along. I really
think she loved my father but I had the feeling that she often wondered if she
hadn't married him, that she might have 'Become Someone’. So I think she was
determined to see to it that I had the opportunity she felt she may have
missed. I was in acting and dancing school before I ever hit Kindergarten. I
really took to the dancing. I was pretty good. I am pretty good. When I
graduated High School, I danced for a Ballet Company they were trying to start
in Minneapolis. It lasted a year.”  
“One of my friends had a contact with a new company starting up in San
Francisco, so we headed out there. They took us both on. They lasted two years
before folding. But what a great two years. We did exciting avant-garde stuff.
There wasn't much money, but the social life was incredible. Can you picture
the wide-eyed girl from the suburbs of Minneapolis hitting that scene! It was
Alice in Wonderland. After the company closed, I waited table a while but
there didn't seem to be any possibilities developing. I heard that Las Vegas
was booming, headed out here, but wasn't able to make any of the shows. So I
started at the Diamond Club. Now I know people make jokes about strippers, but
damn it what I do is good. It's art!" Growling at customers? I guess, maybe..

.  
She had off Thursday night. We decided to go out on the town after our
afternoon exploration. We started at the Golden Nugget, downtown, and worked
our way up to the Starlight, then the Flamingo. Roulette was her game. She
said she had a sure fire system some old boyfriend taught her. It was too
complicated for me to follow, but she didn't do badly. We had dinner at the
Tropicana, then headed back to the Desert Inn to catch the late show. It was a
singer who was a hot shot the 50's playing out his last days.  
"Christ this is boring" She said, and before I could suggest we leave, she was
under the table. I could feel her unzipping my fly then her warm mouth
engulfed my cock. I looked around furtively. No one seemed to notice. Maybe
that older couple that seemed to be straining to look straight ahead. She is
an extraordinarily good cocksucker, and when I came I thought it would never
end. When I was finally done, she popped up, wiped her lips, and with a wide
grin chirped "Now that's entertainment!”  
  
Our last time together was the Saturday afternoon before she left for work. It
consisted of quiet, relaxed more or less straight sex. And that wasn’t as
boring as it might sound. God she was good.

"You planning to hang around here much longer?" I asked her  
"No Jerry's coming back in two months" Jerry was the homosexual set designer
she sub-leased from. He was responsible for the apartment’s quirky erotic
furnishings. One notable oddity was the penis shaped night lights.  
"I think I'll head to LA and try my luck there.“  
When it was time to go I kissed her deeply, got up and started to dress.

”You know it's customary for a gentleman to leave a girl a tip."  
She was lying naked in bed, looking at me, her head up on one elbow.  
"How much you want?"  
"I'm not a prostitute.” she purred “I thought you’d want to leave me a token
of your esteem. But not ten bucks, please, Dick of Steel"  
I slowly peeled off two large. What the hell, it's Vinnie’s money "  
"God your sexy when you do that" She stage whispered.

  
When I got back Eddie was anxious. "How’d it go?"  
"Piece of cake. The arrogant son of a bitch thought he was untouchable. Didn't
take any precautions"  
"You were gone so long I was beginning to worry."  
"Well, I bought a 10 day package like any tourist. Since it was paid for, I
thought I might as well stay and enjoy myself. Besides, I met this really good
looking stripper. God was she a good piece of ass." I didn't get into our
'explorations'. Not being as sophisticated as I, he might think I was becoming
a weirdo.  
"How were things around here?”  
“Pretty good. Some minor hiccups, nothing serious.

  
A week after I got back I was sitting in Grogan’s having lunch when ‘Dapper
Dan’ came in to set up the expected meeting. God that guy was sharp. I
wondered if I should go for that look someday.  
He came over and shook my hand "How ya doin’ Liam? Sorry about spouting off
last time"

"Want some lunch?"  
"Nah, gotta run. Seven O'clock buddy. Murkowski’s" He patted me on the
shoulder and was out the door.  
  
I arrived at Murkowski's at seven on the dot, and grabbed a beer on the way to
the back room. Vinnie was already sitting at the table sipping his whiskey  
“How’d it go? "  
“No problems."  
"Did you tell him it was from Anne Lombardi? "  
“Yes.” I lied. Christ I was supposed to put on a drama show? I just wanted to
do it and get the fuck gone fast  
"What did he say?"  
"What did he say?" I snapped "for Christ’s sake Vinnie, I said ‘this is from
Anne Lombardi' and put four slugs in him. What the fuck can he say?”  
"That's too bad. I would have liked him to have had time to think about it."  
I shrugged." What are you hearing?" I asked  
"Vincenzo’s furious. He flew to Vegas as soon as he heard. It was a
professional looking hit, it had mob written all over it. There are several of
the Families operating in Vegas and he's sure it was one of them. There were
two witnesses, a stripper and one of the valets. All they saw was a car
driving away. Didn't pay much attention, didn't get the license number, and
only a vague description of the car. As I said, it looked like a mob hit, and
civilians usually don't like to remember much. Vincenzo sweated them both, but
they didn't say anything different.“  
Way to go Marci.  
“What the fuck was he doing parked in the corner of the lot anyway?"  
"He drove there to get a blow job from a stripper. Then I'm guessing they
decided to go somewhere else, and she went to get her things. Why he made her
walk I have no idea. He sounded like a guy who enjoyed making things difficult
for people. He had a reputation as a real asshole. How about you. Anyone
looking at you?"  
"Nah, the thought may have passed through their minds, but basically I'm still
just a Bookie. I'm not really a player. And like I told you, if I went out
looking for a hit man, it'd be all over the street. And they know that. A
professional hit!“ he mused “and only the second time out! You have a natural
talent for this Liam."  
You point the gun and pull the trigger what the fuck kind of talent does that
take.  
"Here’s your change. A little under twenty grand. "  
"You spent over 10 grand in ten days? You must have been living high. I expect
the receipts in my office by tomorrow"  
I looked at him confused.  
"For Christ’s sake Sean” he cackled “just kidding. I really appreciate this. I
really do. No one else knows about it, right? You didn't shack up with some
broad."  
"No, I basically just hung out"  
"So no pillow talk" he looked me straight in the eye "and you didn't confide
in your buddy, Eddy"  
I returned his look and lied "No, for Christ’s Sake, I told you. I considered
this a private deal."  
We continued staring at each other. “So absolutely no one knows about this but
you and me?”  
Suddenly, the ramifications of what he said struck both of us. He started to
laugh again. I said “If I didn't know you better, I'd be very nervous about
now."  
I trusted Vinnie totally, but started packing and looking over my shoulder
anyway. I told Eddy to keep his eyes and ears open too. But in the end, Vinnie
was straight.

But as the months dragged on it looked as though Vincenzo wasn’t going to let
it drop. He continued to push, trying to get some answers. Both Vinnie and I
were becoming increasingly apprehensive. Then, to add to my anxiety, about
three months later there was a piece in the paper about a dancer, Marci
Thorsten, whose mutilated, naked body was found in a dumpster in LA. She had
been raped and tortured. Christ, I was devastated. I really liked her. A lot.
Given her life style though I convinced myself she probably hooked up with the
wrong freaks. After all, if it was the Mafia they would have made her
disappear. Well, that is unless they meant to send a message. Even so, the
trail would go cold in Pittsburgh. Wouldn’t it? Wouldn’t it?
