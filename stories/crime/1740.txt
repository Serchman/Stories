CHAPTER 1  
  
Imprisoned light of red and blue flash intermittently within the pear drops of
heavy rain that settle, for a moment, upon the detective's windscreen. A heavy
foot on the brake of the dark blue Studbaker Coupe sends a deluge from the
roof racing forward, only to be smacked aside by windscreen wipers on their
highest setting. The rain falls regardless and once again crystals of red and
blue form a mirror to the police lights from up the street. Not a good day to
investigate a homicide, but then again, what is?  
Detective Millinger places a burdensome hand on the tacky, matt black door
handle and a big, strong arm eases it open. The still dry rubber door seal
squeaks in retaliation before Millinger can feel the rush of humid air,
heavily laden with sooty smelling carbon monoxide and the cheap oil smell of
downtown suburbia. Placing his shiny leather shoes on the dark curb, he hoists
the bulk of his frame from the vehicle. There he stands, placing his black
trilby hat on firmly with one hand and patting smart the breast of his suit
with the other. Millinger doesn't look first to the crime scene, its 9:53 a.m
and his stomach makes him look first for breakfast. Whilst scanning the fast-
food restaurants and coffee houses he hits the scent of warm bagels, but all
he sees is people huddled in doorways with umbrellas shadowing their frowning
faces. Their inquisitive eyes all looking in one direction, with three of the
staff from McDonalds just standing there letting their blue pin-stripe
uniforms darken in the rain. Good luck being served today Millinger thought as
he made his way towards the scene of their bemusement with an almost time-
slowing calm.  
One black-and-white is parked at a thirty-five degree angle in the road,
causing a bottleneck of traffic and subsequent beeping horns and rut-tut-tuts
of growling, impatient engines. The other black-and-white is on the sidewalk ,
blocking off the civilians. Four young rookie cops dance around hopelessly
with cordoning off tape to set up a no-go (and would you really want to?)
perimeter. This is going to be big Millinger though.  
As accustomed as a boxer getting into a ring, Millinger slides below the tape
reading 'POLICE LINE DO NOT CROSS'. Detective Fenton, wearing an unassuming
brown suit and brown tie leans against the black-and-white with one arm
crossed and one hand over his goatee beard. He flicks a few fingers up to
acknowledge Millinger but remains focussed on the body. Detective Lameck
struggles with an umbrella handle between his arm and ribcage and a Hasselblad
1600f camera in his other hand.  
'Ok then, what's the story?' snaps Millinger impatiently. Lameck fumbles one
last photo and shuffles sheepishly towards him, 'w-w-well, its gonna be big
sir, and y-y-yousee this here is Richard Impellitteri, son of Mayor Vincent
Impellitteri.  
'And why does this make it big detective Lameck?  
'I-I-It just might have further implications to a wider .....' Detective
Fenton stands up right and cuts in with a sublimate stare to Lameck.  
'What Lameck is trying to say is that this IS big chief. You see Vincent, like
any father, is gonna want to see perpetrators come to justice'  
'And french-fried for the trouble right?'  
'Right, but in this case it seems that the perpetrators are the people who
have an underworld connection with the smooth business transactions that keep
our beloved mayor in pocket and popularity'.  
'Look Fenton, you know it, I know it, everyone knows it, but we just don't
speak of it anymore. Our jobs depend on it'  
Millinger places a hand on Fentons shoulder and leads him slightly away from
Lameck, who stands there perky as an ostrich, seeing everything but
understanding nothing. Dumb as a bird. In hushed tones and team huddle
Millinger and Fenton talk.  
'MAFIA? You really think so?'  
'Look chief, its trade mark Italian Walk of Death.'  
Both detectives go over to the body and crouch down beside it.  
'Ignore his face, that got scraped off during the fall, I mean look at they
way he is on the ground, his legs all kicked up at the back but his arms by
his sides. He didn't put his arms out to stop his fall, you know what that
means?'  
'Dead before he hits the floor.'  
'Right, and judging by the distance his face dragged on the curb, he was
running. The bullet, probably high calibre rifle, enters here in the small of
the back, severing the spinal chord.' Fenton lifts up the tail of the mans
sodden suit to show the hole in the fabric, Millinger peers into the hole to
see the perfect round wound and blood stained white shirt, now pink from the
wash of the rain.  
'It was either a hell of a good shot, or very lucky chief. But that ain't the
best bit, what makes the 'walk' so important and not just the 'death'?'  
Fenton Kneels down by one of the bucked up legs of the body and grips the shoe
at the end, turning it so that the sole is facing the two detectives.  
'Y-Y-You want me to take a photo of that chief?' Lameck says with bounding
enthusiasm and nearly tripping over himself in an effort to make himself
useful.  
'No thank you Lameck, you just keep an eye out for anyone looking suspicious'
says Millinger.  
The two detectives turn their attention back to the sole of the shoe.  
'LIB-EN-ARCHY, Libenarchy, it says, and a size forty-two. Hand made finest
Italian shoes no doubt. Forty-seven on a man who must be, ooh, six feet tall
wouldn't you say? Mighty strange, I'd be expecting at least a forty-six. Now,
if my hunch is correct...'  
Fenton eases off the shoe to reveal the man's foot, but instead of five
delicate toes there are five blackened gelatine stumps. Fenton raises the
sleeve of his arm to his face and wipes the sweat and rain from his brow
before screwing it into a knot of disgust. Millinger looks on unperturbed, his
black hair all laid flat by the rain like corn in a storm and his focused blue
eyes only flick to the other shoe to motion Fenton to take it off. Again,
instead of five delicate toes there are five clumsy stumps.  
'This poor bastard had to run with no toes only to be shot in the back by some
cruel assassin. What did you do to piss them off that much?'  
Millinger stands up and looks around, his stomach grumbling the words 'food'.
The skies are grey, the people are grey, even the light seem grey today,
colourless, lifeless, humourless. Even the curiosity and epitome of mortality
seems to have subsided with the rain as the people walk on by the murder
scene, bored with the lack of game-show noises and fluorescent teeth. The
'mortuary- mobile' is making slow headway through the traffic in the distance.
Millinger knew a statement would be required soon. The five rookie cops would
soon be back with notepads full of empty statements, as always. Millinger
calls over Fenton and Lameck.  
'Lameck, you handle press, notepad, right this down, word for word, Homicide,
Caucasian male, mid twenties, drive-by shooting, investigation ongoing. Then
get in touch with H.Q, homicide, Richard Impellitteri, gangland execution,
leads being followed. This is going to be big'.  
  
CHAPTER 2  
  
In the Cobble Hill Italian quarters of Brooklyn, Millinger and Fenton drive as
unassumingly as possible, glad of the tint in their tinted windows. The street
lamps are kept on night and day for that 'extra' security, but darkness would
surely be a blessed relief for this place. Then you wouldn't see the cars with
no wheels resting on bricks stolen from houses with no doors. You wouldn't see
territorial graffiti with smashed up bottles and rusty beer cans beneath them
looking like they had spilt the oil slick and rubbish sick around them. You
wouldn't see the bums with no teeth slumped against benches with no slats,
begging not for money, but for god to take them quickly.  
'God what a complete dump, a shit-hole would be ashamed of this, you really
think that Libenarchy place is going to be round here chief?'  
'Well this is the right address they gave us ain't it? Hang on, would you look
at that'.  
A corner shop stands out like no other at the crossroads ahead. Amongst such
deprivation and boarded up buildings there lies a shop that wouldn't look out
of place on Broadway. Two gleaming windows sit framed by royal green painted
woodwork and gold lettering reading 'LIBENARCHY' across the signboard. Beneath
it in smaller letters reads 'Italians Finest' and the number '93' just above
the door. Only fear could make the desperate leave this place alone. Millinger
brings the Studbaker to a gentle stop outside and they both look in wonder at
this rose amongst thorns.  
  
  
'Fenton we need to decide pretty quick which way we are going to take this. Do
we dig this up, or bury it deep? Uncover or cover up?'  
'Lets see what were dealing with first chief, I could, and I hope I am, be
wrong about the Italian Walk of Death. This is just too easy don't you think?  
'Either way, this place has got my attention now, even if its just because I
might want me a pair of them fancy Italian Shoes'.  
Millinger and Fenton both get out of the cab and unfasten the holsters on
their compact .38 calibre standard issue Colt Detective Specials and hide them
again beneath their jackets. Before they get to the shop a sheepish voice
stirs from nowhere. 'You boys fancy some new shoes hu? Toot-a-doodle dandy
what's wrong with dem ones?'  
Like a Congo soldier camouflaged to the jungle this urban junkie was
camouflaged to his. The grey rags of his clothes all merged into one and the
skeleton of his lifeless body leans against the dirty wall like a puppet with
no strings. Even his angular face and mop of grey-black hair and beard seem to
be struggling to move without the motivation of his mind. Empty eyes reflect
the sky and only words and crooked smile hint to his soul.  
'I see all kinds of shmucks going in dere wearin the smartest shoes you ever
saw, but still they come out wid a new pair, don't even let me have their old
ones, jus so I can eat'.  
The old beggar now had Millinger's attention, so he went and knelt down beside
him, casually taking a dime from his trouser pocket. The tramp stirred a
little, but not much, Millinger looked to Fenton and pointed to the box on the
dashboard of the car. Fenton retrieved the box and walked back towards them.
There he stood on front of the bum and opened the box, the lid said 'Irish
Earls Pizza' and Fenton took out a slice of meat feast with extra pepperoni
and began to eat it. The bum's eyes sparked into life and his dry mouth began
to lubricate with saliva.  
'Dat for me boss, please' the bum begged. 'Could be', Millinger said without
empathy.  
'First we ask you some questions'. Millinger pulled a cutting from his breast
pocket, an old cutting from a publicity campaign run by mayor Impellitteri
which shows his now dead son by his side. 'Do you recognise this young man in
the picture? Has he ever come here?' The bum squinted his eyes to get a good
look and then spat the saliva from his mouth.  
'Dat sum-da bitch com here all the time, no good city-slick-prick , never once
he gave me sumin to eat or drink'.  
'Your sure you've seen him come here, to this shop?'  
'He mus have so many gad damn shoes he be a centipede, now, that pizza goin
beggin?'  
Millinger nods and Fenton chucks the pizza box to the mans feet, where his
toes stick out of his worn down shoes and say hello to the air. Millinger and
Fenton stand and look to each other, their curiosity like lightening before
thunder.
