**Aviator Sunglasses

Steven Hunley  
He only took the call because he was in his neighborhood. Some perp had
kidnapped a girl. They were even on a street only two blocks away from where
he lived. When he pulled up on his bike, the other black and whites were
already there, forming a ring facing the house.  
"What's up?"he said to the detective in charge as he took off his helmet.  
"Oh, hi Johnny, some perp is holding a hostage inside, he's all mixed up, even
called 911 on himself. Can you beat that?"  
"Yeah, probably some kind of nut. How old's the girl?"  
"About seven I think."  
That made Johnny mad. That was the same age as his kid. He got on his radio
and called 911 for details. Then he looked at the layout. It had been an early
call. The sun was low, the house faced west. 911 didn't have many details. The
girl had been walking to school from two blocks away with a group of friends
when he snatched her up. They still didn't have her name. He tied her up and
threatened to kill her and himself. He sounded nervous.  
"If he was nervous then he's more nervous now," thought Johnny, "with all
these black and whites around."  
All the officers were hiding behind their patrol cars. They knew the danger.
Johnny pondered a minute. It made him mad. Hell, it could be his daughter
there, his Maria, tied up and scared. And the jerk pulled it off in his
neighborhood too! The nerve of the guy! So he formulated a plan. He decided to
break cover.  
He suddenly stood up, in full view of the house. The other officers' eyes grew
wide.  
"What the Hell's he doing?" one said.  
He faced the house, and behind it, the sun. His dark aviator sunglasses made
him look like General Douglas MacArthur, the liberator of the Philippines. He
placed his feet well apart.  
"Whadda you doing Johnny?" said one of them, "Where's your Kevlar?"  
The sun was glinting off his badge directly through the open window where he'd
seen the curtain move. Inside the room it made a hot spot on the wallpaper,
caressing the hair of the girl wrapped in rope huddling against the wall. The
perp saw it too, his sweaty hand clutching the 9mm Beretta. He would pay
attention now.

As Johnny's pupils dilated, his irises turned a cruel uncaring pale blue, like
sniper's eyes. He stared directly at the window.  
He freed the cold hard steel from its holster. He slid the receiver back with
a soft touch, cocking the gun. He faced the house and said these words quite
softly, but forming each one carefully with his mouth.  
"Get ready for death," he said, "Get ready for death right now."  
The perp watched from the window.  
"I'll see your muzzle flash," he said softly, enunciating the words carefully,
"then it's all over."  
"What the Hell's he doing?" said one of the others, "talking to himself? Why
doesn't he use the bullhorn? Why doesn't he move back?"  
The perp watched closely from the window while the little girl watched the
gold hotspot dancing gaily across the curtains.  
"I always get my man," said Johnny, forming with extra care the words, "dead
or alive."  
At this, the perp near the window lost his sweaty grip on his Baretta, and
melted, like hot wax off a birthday candle. Like the candle, he went out cold,
right there on the floor.  
When the reporters interviewed Johnny later he boasted proudly,  
"It was the easiest arrest I ever made. Not a shot fired. Out cold when we
cuffed him. No Miranda act, no hassle, out cold. But it isn't me who's gonna
take all the credit. I give half of it to the girl down at 911. She's the one
who told me he was deaf."  
You can imagine the surprise on Johnny's face when the officers were bringing
out the little girl wrapped up in a blanket. She broke free and ran straight
to him crying, "Daddy, Daddy, you're my hero now for sure," she said jumping
up into his arms, "I'm sooo glad that's over."  
I think what he said was, "Maria?" though I can't be sure, I wasn't there.
