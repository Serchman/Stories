**** Intro:** It was meant to be a new beginning for Julie. Instead her life has become a living nightmare.

The room is small, lit by a harsh flourescent glare. In the middle of the room
is a table and on it sits an ashtray heaped with stubs, along with several
plastic cups containing tea and coffee dregs. Around the table sit four
people. On one side are two men, Detective Mike Gerber and his partner.
Opposite them sit a man and woman. The woman's name is Julie Harrison. Aged
32, she's slim and not unattractive. The man next to her is Julie's lawyer.  
Julie's mind is still numb with incredulity. The plan had sounded so simple.
It was meant to be a new beginning. Instead her life has spiralled into a
living nightmare.  
It had started some months earlier, in the chill of a snowy February. Julie
was tired. Of her job; of a dead-in-the-water marriage; of life. She and some
colleagues had gone to a bar for a drink after work. That's when she'd met Dan
Arlen. Around the same age as Julie, he was tall and ruggedly handsome, with
volcanic blue eyes and the cutest smile. He worked as a car mechanic and was
new to the city. And he was single.  
They saw each other as often as they could, spending most of their time at the
camper which was Dan's home. He'd tantalised her with talk of a future
together, Julie had agreed to divorce her husband but Dan had said there was a
quicker, easier way.  
They'd been sitting on a park bench at the time, blossom falling like rain
from the trees on either side.  
"Kill him? Are you sure?"  
Dan had nodded. "The divorce is bound to be messy, right? From what you've
told me about him he'll fight you for every cent. Just think, the house will
be all yours and the life insurance will be enough for us to make a fresh
start."  
No need to worry, Dan had said. He'd make it look like a burglary gone wrong.
He had contacts from whom he could purchase an unregistered handgun. And he
and Julie could give themselves a cast-iron alibi.  
"We'll say we were together the whole time. It's perfect. The cops will
probably suspect us but they won't be able to prove anything."  
Julie remembers the Saturday just gone only too well. She'd told Mark some
friends of hers were having an all night party and she wouldn't be home until
the following morning. Then she'd gone to see Dan. She'd stayed with him until
midnight when he'd left to go to her place. She'd given him her spare key and
he'd promised to be back in a couple of hours.  
She'd tried to watch TV, read, anything to occupy her thoughts. She'd paced
around the camper, biting her fingernails. She'd drunk glass after glass of
vodka.  
Her anxiety had increased when Dan had failed to return by 2A.M. She'd rung
his cellphone but it was switched off. Another hour passed. She rang him again
and again but without success. Her stomach churned.  
By 4 A.M. she was frantic. Her mind whirled. Something must have gone wrong.
Perhaps he hadn't succeeded in killing Mark. She pictured the two men
grappling, the gun going off, unintentionally shooting Dan. Maybe he'd been in
some kind of accident, or been the victim of a mugging. Icy waves of dread
washed over her.  
When she could stand it no longer she'd called a cab and gone over to the
house. Drawing up outside, she'd seen Mark's car parked in the drive, the
place unsurprisingly in darkness.  
Stepping into the house, she'd flicked on the lights and found everything
undisturbed. So Dan hadn't gone through with it. Perhaps he'd lost his nerve.
But why hadn't he called, or returned to the camper?  
Taking off her coat, she'd climbed the stairs slowly, so as not to disturb
Mark who'd be in bed, sleeping. She'd opened the bedroom door and crept
inside. The vague light of a full moon shone through the window, illuminating
the bed.  
Julie froze. Mark was lying there, eyes staring sightlessly upward. His bare
chest was exposed and a cluster of dark holes indicated he'd been shot several
times in the heart.  
Julie bolted from the room and hurled herself down the stairs, frantic sobs
tearing themselves from her chest. Although she'd talked about the killing,
the actual sight of Mark's lifeless body had shaken her to the core. And
through it all one question pounded in her brain: why hadn't Dan made it look
like a burglary, as he'd said.  
Another part of her mind told her she had to think clearly. She'd have to
phone the cops - therefore she had to make it look like a bungled robbery, as
she and Dan had planned. Scrabbling in her purse, she pulled out her cellphone
and called him again but there was still no reply. What was he playing at?  
She couldn't worry about that now. She'd force the lock on the kitchen door,
then go through the house ripping out drawers and strewing the contents over
the floor (but not in the bedroom - she couldn't face going back in there).
She'd tell the cops some money had been taken. She'd have to tell them about
the affair, of course, and Dan's disappearance had wrecked their alibi. (Where
was he? Why wouldn't he answer his phone?) However, although they'd be
suspects, as Dan had said, the cops had no proof against either of them.  
Looking back, Julie marvels at how quickly it all unravelled.  
"I notice the desk in the study is locked, Mrs Harrison," Detective Gerber had
said. "Why didn't the burglar try to force it open, I wonder? Then there are
your jewels. You say the pieces are only cheap imitation but whoever broke in
wasn't to know that, was he? But you know what really puzzles me? The way Mr
Harrison was killed. You see, he was in bed when he was shot. Which means he
couldn't have disturbed the burglar. Whoever shot him must have gone into the
bedroom and fired. As if the whole thing was premeditated. And what about the
neighbors? How come they didn't hear anything?"  
Then came the killer punch. The cops had found a pistol hidden in the loft
along with a pillow which had evidently been used to smother the sound of
gunshots. Julies' fingerprints were on the gun which had been confirmed as the
murder weapon.  
That's when Julie had broken down and confessed. She'd told them all about the
plot to kill her husband. But it had been Dan who'd shot him, not her.  
"Can't you see? The bastard's set me up."  
"But why, Mrs Harrison? What possible motive could he have?"  
"I don't know, but you have to believe me."  
They don't, of course. The cops have checked out what Julie's told them about
Dan Arlen but have drawn a blank. The camper's vanished and no-one of that
name or description has ever been employed at the place Dan said he'd worked.
As for the cellphone, it's registered in a different name and the address
given turned out to be a derelict building.  
The cops haven't pursued it. Why would they? They already have their evidence.
Fortunately for Julie there's no death penalty in this state. But she knows
she's looking at a life stretch.  
The detectives keep on at her. "Why don't you come clean, Mrs Harrison? Make
it easy on yourself?"  
Eventually, unable to take anymore, Julie starts to scream.  
  
The man calling himself Dan Arlen snips an article from a newspaper and pastes
it into a scrapbook containing a number of other clippings. "WIFE CHARGED WITH
HUSBAND'S MURDER," proclaims the headline. The other stories carry similar
banners. Once again it has worked like a dream, the fingerprints being a
particularly neat touch. Easy to transfer them from a glass to another object
with the aid of sticky tape.  
Closing the scrapbook, he stores it in a cupboard alongside various fake ID's.
Taking his jacket and wallet, he steps out of the camper into the warm evening
air and heads for the nearest bar. Here he is - another town, another state.
Best to keep moving around. It's safer that way.  
He may not strike lucky tonight. But sooner or later, in some joint or
another, he's confident he'll find what he's looking for. A woman stuck in an
unhappy marriage; who yearns for freedom; who's agreeable to the killing of
her husband.  
Someone he can add to his collection.
