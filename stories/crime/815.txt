**** Intro:** the third 

* * *

So maybe no more comas; but my problems definitely do not stop at a courthouse
while crime still exists. The UDCU is getting bigger, and I think there is a
snitch. As an independent fighter, I get to infiltrate the meetings of all the
big crime lords in the cities. I live on the outskirts of Los Angeles with
Jack. Fran and Greg live with Jack's brother J.R and my father two sisters and
mother live in their enormous house on the ocean which was rebuilt after my
father returned as Chief Officer.  
  
I ran down the back alley of a warehouse at the loading dock.  
"Alright Mitch" I spoke to my earpiece "Tell me the situation." Mitch was my
partner.  
"His name is Larry Gandas. He's making a deal with the Chinese opium dealing
dynasty the Chi Wongs at warehouse 154 on Market Ave."  
"Be there in a sec." I took a left onto Farewell drive which put me onto
Market Ave. "154...154...Ah!" I leveled my gun and kicked open the doors, but
no one was there. I turned and saw Jack in the doorway.  
"Jack?"  
"Holly...I-"His mouth fell open and he fell forward, a knife protruding from
his back. I screamed in terror as cold numbing dread washed over my body and I
couldn't breathe.  
  
"...Holly...Holly...are you okay?" I opened my eyes to Jack's face and
realized we were in our bedroom in our apartment. "You screamed." I threw the
covers off and ran to the bathroom, seeing tear lines down my face. Jack
followed me in, observing me with a look of concern on his face. I washed my
face with cold water.  
"It was only a bad dream."  
"Of what?"  
"You died."  
"No...baby I'm still here."  
"I know it was only a dream but it scared me." He came up behind me and put
his arms around my waist, kissing my neck.  
"Don't be scared, I'll protect you."  
"But if you die-"  
"Listen babe, I wouldn't leave you here, I'd at least take you with me." he
smiled playfully. I hit him on the arm  
"Jack- this is serious."  
"As serious as me with French fries." I smiled at him, feeling safe again.  
"Oh, I didn't know you thought it was THAT serious."  
"Hey...there's only so serious it can be, and when my woman says serious, I
bring out the code red serious." I laughed as he smiled at me and picked me
up.  
  
I checked on Fran during my lunch break, she was with Greg and seemed to be
doing okay. So I drove back to the UDCU and went to the coffee room. I
overheard pieces of coffee room chat usually about work related rigs and
scandals.  
"...and they were ambushed."  
"How many are hurt?"  
"Not THAT many, but still a significant amount, their commander took the
blunt."  
"Commander?" I chimed in  
"Oh Holly, Hey! Commander of the rush mates."  
"What division?" I asked feeling my blood turn cold,  
"The third-"Kelley answered realizing Jack was the commander. "Holly...I'm
so..." she was cut off as I spun and ran to the infirmary. The head of the
infirmary was a small chubby doctor who was losing his hair named Darrell.  
"Holly." He said knowingly "He's in here," He spoke over his shoulder leading
me to the ICU room. Jack had bruises on his face and a bandage on his left
arm, hiding his tattoo. His eyes opened slowly.  
"Holly," He whispered.  
"Oh Jack." I kissed him lightly he smiled and fell unconscious.  
  
  
I turned my key in the lock and heard it click. I opened the door and walked
inside my now empty house. It was empty without Jack there. I want a dog, I
thought as I dropped my bag and keys on the kitchen counter. A dog would be
nice...always waiting here for me when I get home. Then I realized it would be
irrational since Jack and I work all the time and often have to travel. Maybe
a cat...they're good at being independent, right? Maybe I'll pick up a dog for
a night...Ohh, this is pathetic. I walked out into the TV room and switched on
the news channel. The normal doom-and-gloom perspective of the Channel 11 News
Team flooded the house. Why do they always have to be so gloomy? They have no
idea what really goes on out there. I, on the other hand, do. Unfortunately.  
Suddenly there was a knocking on the front door. I went to open it and, to my
surprise, saw J.R. standing on my front porch.  
"Hey," he said, looking down at his feet. "How's Jack?" He managed to offer up
a weak smile.  
"He's doing alright. Wanna come in?" I offered with a suggestive look on my
face. Maybe I wouldn't have to be too lonely tonight...  
"I really only came to stay a second...." He looked serious.  
"Okay then, what's this about?"  
"I wan-" He leaned in and kissed me lightly on the lips. I stood there for a
moment, shocked. He leaned in again. His soft lips ever so gently grazed mine.
I slowly opened my eyes and led him into my house. I closed the door behind
him and turned the deadbolt. Click. The door was locked and J.R. and I were
left completely alone in the house. It was so wrong, yet something about it
felt right. Who needs a dog? I thought to myself. J.R. looked at me with a
question in his eyes. I wondered what it was. He didn't let me wonder for
long.  
"Do you have any food? Fran and Greg eat all of my food." I was in a daze.  
"Yeah...let me get some for you." I walked into the kitchen and fixed him a
peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I put it on a plate with a little floral
decoration along the edges. Jack and I bought these together, I thought
momentarily as I walked out into the foyer where he was still standing. I
brushed the thought out of my mind. I don't need to think about Jack right
now. "Do you want to sit down?" I tried to avoid looking at him too much. I
already felt too tempted. This is what being lonely does to me. I should have
gotten a dog instead.  
"Sure. Uh...thanks, for the sandwich and all." He took a seat in the nearby
living room on an ataman. I sat across the room on the couch. I was twirling
my hair between my fingers; it was a nervous habit I couldn't seem to shake.
Jack never favored it.  
"So, you just came here for food, huh?" I shot him a playful look and he
smiled gently.  
"I thought you'd be lonely with Jack gone. I came to keep you company." Oh,
you did much more than that, I thought to myself and had to manage to hold
back a giggle.  
"Thanks. That was very, uhm, sweet of you." I didn't know why I let him kiss
me. I loved Jack, which was for sure. I was just lonely, right?  
"Yeah, what can I say, I'm a sweet guy." He smiled playfully and I smiled back
at him.  
"Well, that's for sure. But then again, I already knew that." I winked at him
and I thought I caught a glimpse of him blushing; the first time I'd ever seen
him blush. I looked over and noticed he had already finished the sandwich.
"Would you like something to drink?"  
"I'd love some lemonade, if you have any." For the first time in a long time,
I noticed how boyishly cute he was.  
"Sure, I have some in the refrigerator." I left him in the living room and
grabbed a glass. I opened the refrigerator door and began pulling out the
lemonade when I felt a soft caress on the small of my back. I put the lemonade
back on the shelf of the fridge and let J.R. turn me around. We started
kissing again. I don't know why I kept letting this happen. I was supposed to
be married to Jack; his brother. Before I knew it, he had me pinned up against
the refrigerator. This was getting intense. All of the sudden I heard an
almost inaudible knock on the door. The doorknob started to turn. Shit, I
thought. Then I remembered I had locked the deadbolt. Good thing. Then the
knocking grew louder. "I have to get that." I said as I looked at J.R. He
looked disappointed.  
"No, you really don't." He said as he kept me pinned.  
"Holly? It's me, Fran." I heard her voice reverberate across the room. Then I
heard footsteps going up the steps to my back door. Damn.  
"Yes, I do. Now, go sit in the living room." He gave me a pleading look. I
pointed to the ataman he had been sitting on. "Now!" I'm not demanding, I
thought sarcastically. "I'm coming Fran!" I opened the back door.  
"I need to talk to you." She said, looking down at the floor.  
"Okay, come on in," I said as I led her into the kitchen. I was lucky that she
hadn't decided to go to the back door any sooner since it led directly into
the kitchen where J.R. and I had been kissing just moments ago. Thank goodness
she hadn't seen any of it; or had she? We walked into the living room
together. She immediately noticed J.R. sitting on the ataman. He looked
stunned that I hadn't gotten rid of her. I can't get rid of her, she's family
and it's rude, I mouthed to him. He gave me a look that said I can't believe
you.  
"J.R.! What are you doing here?" Fran said, looking increasingly confused by
the second.  
"I just came over to talk to Holly about Jack's condition." He lied. He didn't
care about Jack's condition at all. In fact, he had just come here to kiss his
brother's wife; while his brother was in the hospital. "Why are you here?"  
"I came to talk to Holly about Greg. We've been having some problems getting
along lately. It's kind of girl stuff. Did you hear everything you needed to
about Jack?" Damnit, she was going to make him leave.  
"Yeah, I guess I've heard-"  
"Okay then, can you leave so I can talk to Holly in private?" She was so
blissfully unaware. Thank God. J.R. got up and started to walk out. "Thanks
for understanding, J.R."  
"Sure," he said and smiled over his shoulder. "Holly, I'll talk to you later?"
I knew what he meant by that. In other words, he would wait until he saw Fran
leave and then he would be back.  
"Yeah, okay I'll talk to you...soon." I gave him a knowing look and he smiled
that brilliant smile at me. Man, he looks a lot like Jack. UH! Again with
Jack...  
"What's up Fran?" I took my seat on the couch again and she sat across from me
in the Lay Z Boy.  
"Sure, Greg's nice and all but he gets really mad sometimes. Like the other
day, I was just talking to him and I mentioned this other guy that I knew, and
he got like all protective and stuff. And, I dunno, I guess I'm just like ya
know...not used to that." She looked up at me. She was sitting crouched over
with her forearms resting on her thighs and her hands clasped and just off of
her knees. The way she looked at me gave it away.  
"Fran, I know that's not why you came here." I walked upstairs and opened my
underwear drawer, sifted through my undergarments. A-ha! I grabbed it and
walked downstairs again. She was still sitting in the same exact position. She
knew I knew and that Jack would never find out. Fran and I were like this; we
were friends even though I was older. I liked that, I liked the fact that she
trusted me like this. We really were becoming sisters; it wasn't just
something that was loosely used because I had merely married Jack. Now it was
a real sisterly relationship. I walked over to her and handed her the condom.
She took it without a word. She wouldn't look up at me. "Fran, you know its
okay. As long as you're careful and smart about it. Which you are being since
you came here to get this. So just, be careful, and make sure he treats you
right." I gave her a concerned look and she smiled at me.  
"I will be, I promise." She got up and unlocked the front door. She turned
around to look at me. "Thank you, Holly. I really appreciate this." She opened
the door and walked out onto the porch and closed the door behind her. I
watched her descend the front steps and turn the street corner. She was
walking home. I knew what she was going to do. I pushed the thought of it out
of my mind. J.R. walked in with a questioning look on his face.  
"What was that about?" He closed the front door and locked the deadbolt again.  
"Oh...nothing." I smiled at him and he came closer to me. "J.R., what exactly
is it that we're doing?" I looked him up and down, trying to seriously figure
him out.  
"I don't know. It's better not to think." He said as he slid his hands around
my waist and came in to kiss me. I closed my eyes and let it happen. I closed
my eyes and didn't open them. I let it all happen, all of it. The rest of the
night went smoothly. I had dinner...eventually. I turned off all of the lights
and went up to bed. Thoughts of J.R. wouldn't leave my mind, but they didn't
have to.  
  
  
  
The next morning came too soon. I looked over at the other side of my huge
king sized bed. I almost expected Jack to be sleeping there, almost. Instead,
I saw J.R. I was consumed with feelings of guilt. I had to leave. I just had
to get out, go somewhere, anywhere. I carefully got out of bed and slipped
into some sweats. I walked into the bathroom and grabbed my face wash,
toothbrush, toothpaste, and mouthwash. I walked downstairs and went to the
kitchen sink. There was no way I was going to risk waking up J.R. Joseph Ryan.
Hmm, maybe I'll just call him Ryan instead of J.R. Yeah, Ryan, I like
that...Oh my God that really happened? Last night really happened? Oh, God;
tell me it was a dream. A horrible, horrible nightmare...I wouldn't cheat on
my husband! Would I? I washed my face and brushed my teeth. I rinsed my mouth
out with mouthwash and grabbed my car keys. I ran out the door and hurried
into my car. The tires screeched as I pulled out of my parking space and flew
down the road, tears streaming down my face. No, no! That couldn't have been
real!! That didn't happen!! I love Jack! I LOVE JACK! I was hysterical now. I
almost couldn't see, but I knew where I was going. I knew this city well
enough almost to drive with my eyes closed. I pulled into a parking space in
the hospital's parking lot and took the stairs three at a time. I ran into
Jack's room and collapsed beside his bed.  
"Jack, baby, honey!! I love you!! I love you so so much!! Please, please
believe me!! I love you!!" I was crying so hard I could barely catch my
breath. I caught a glimpse of Jack's startled, slowly becoming terrified face.  
"Holly, babe; I believe you. I love you, too. Now, tell me what's wrong.
What's on your mind?" He gave me that usual caring look that he's so good at
giving. My heart melted and I started crying even harder. I couldn't do this
for much longer. I forced myself to stop crying and I just looked up at him
from where I had fallen. I stood up and smiled sheepishly.  
"I'm sorry that I was so dramatic. I just had a nightmare where you didn't get
better. Actually, you got worse. You died. And I couldn't take it. I woke up
and I just had to see you right away. I love you sweetie, but now I need to go
calm myself down. I think I'll go to a breakfast diner and get some coffee and
something to eat. Sorry I scared you." I smiled at him and kissed him on the
lips. I immediately felt a pang of guilt for last night.  
"alright... You just go calm yourself down and come and see me later, sound
good? I love you too." He smiled and I almost died right there. I nodded and
walked out of his room.  
I left the hospital and climbed into my car. I rested my head on the steering
wheel and let out a deep sigh. Oh God, what have I done? What have I done? The
question kept playing in my head until I was back at my house. I walked
upstairs and peered into my bedroom. Ryan was still sleeping. I'd only been
gone for about an hour, and it was still only 8 AM right now. Jack and I were
early birds. I looked at him for a long time, until I saw him start to stir. I
walked slowly and quietly downstairs and made a pot of coffee. I heard the
shower start upstairs in my bathroom and fixed myself a cup of coffee. I sat
in my Lay Z Boy and drank my coffee, trying not to think. "It's better to not
think." That's what Ryan had said last night. He's right, I thought, it is
better to not think. If only I could do it for a really, really long time.
Until I'm able to accept what happened. That will take a hell of a lot of
time. I sighed and closed my eyes. I heard him coming downstairs. I had fixed
him a plate of breakfast...Cheerio's. It was the best I could do under the
circumstances. I heard him sit down and pour milk into the bowl.  
"Aren't you going to join me?" He called from the kitchen table. I reluctantly
picked up my cup and slowly got out of the comfortable chair. I meandered over
to the kitchen table and sat down adjacent from him. I smiled weakly at him.
"What's the matter with you? Didn't sleep well?" He smiled that same gorgeous
smile. It made me miss Jack.  
"No, actually I really didn't." I again smiled weakly. It was all I could
think to do so he wouldn't ask more probing questions.  
"Aw, what? Did I keep you up past your bedtime?" I winced. I didn't want to
think about what had happened last night, but it wasn't going to go away. It
HAD happened, and that was that. I smiled and said,  
"No, actually, I just had a bad dream. Thanks for keeping me company last
night." He smiled as he took a bite of his cereal. He finished chewing and
looked at me.  
"Aw, come on...I think I did more than just keep you company." He winked at me
and I looked down. His face suddenly became serious. It was quite possibly the
first time that he realized the magnitude of the situation. He ate the rest of
his breakfast in silence. He cleaned up all of the cereal ingredients (a.k.a.
milk, cereal box, bowl, spoon, napkin) and washed his hands. He went to sit
into the living room and sat on his favorite piece of my furniture - the
ataman. "Please, sit with me." He motioned towards the couch. I did what he
told me to. We sat there in silence for a few minutes.  
"I can't believe that last night really happened." I looked up at him with
tears forming in my eyes.  
"Can't? Or won't?" He smiled lack-lustily.  
"Actually, I think a little bit of both." This was no time for games. This was
serious business. He was Jack's brother, I was Jack's wife. This was a
problem. A huge problem.  
"Right, well then. What now?" He looked at me, obviously waiting for an
answer. I shrugged.  
"You honestly expect me to know? I mean, I'm dumbfounded. I still am convinced
that it was a dream." He looked hurt. "I mean, a good dream, but you know it
just doesn't feel real yet." Still that hurt look again. "You know what I
mean!! I'm just in a daze. I haven't fully woken up yet. I haven't even
finished my first cup of coffee. Give me a break."  
"It feels like a dream?" He said, giving me a puppy dog face. Yeah, a damn
good dream, I secretly thought. "Is that a bad thing? Did I do something
wrong? Is this my fault?" I could almost see the questions bouncing around in
his head.  
"It's not a bad thing. You didn't do anything wrong, it's not your fault; I
mean, I let it happen too. But, can we chill it on the questions for a while?
It's still only 9 o'clock in the morning." I smiled drearily at him. I saw his
eyes sparkle. He smiled dreamily. God, I hate how I have a weakness for good
smiles.  
"Alright, but I will have questions later, and I suspect you will too." He
looked at me sideways and I smiled a full-hearted smile. He was flirting with
me again, and boy, did I ever want to flirt back. He got up and started
walking over to me again. My heart fluttered. Damnit, I thought. Why can't I
make this stop? I'm married, for Christ's sake! He didn't stop. I didn't want
him to, either. He got so close to me that I could feel his breath on my neck.
He kissed my neck and slowly began kissing me up to my jaw bone and then
kissed me on the lips. I didn't stop him. I wanted him to continue. It was an
awful, sinful thing to want, but I wanted it full-heartedly. There was no part
of me right now that didn't want this, so I let it happen for the second time.
He started out kissing me lightly, almost like he was testing the waters. Its
all clear water today, baby, perfect for sailing, so go ahead and unleash your
sailboat. I couldn't believe that I had just thought that. First of all, I was
still married to his brother, second of all, it was totally lame and I knew
it. I didn't care.  
He was walking upstairs holding my hand and leading me up with him. I let him
lead me. I knew what was going to happen and I wasn't about to stop it. He was
good...too good. Extremely good; it made me smile. He led me into the bedroom.
He picked me up and I wrapped my legs around him. I fell onto the bed, him
with me. We were kissing passionately, it was so passionate I'm sure if
someone was watching they could see the steam rising off of our bodies. Shit!!
That reminded me, all the doors were unlocked and the drapes open.  
"Hold it!! Hold it!!" He stopped and looked at me, curiously. I giggled. I
felt giddy, like a schoolgirl all over again. "The doors are unlocked. The
drapes are open." I tried to move, but he wouldn't let me.  
"So let them catch us. Let them. Please, Holly. Just...stay." It made my heart
jump. It was exciting...exhilarating, so I agreed. I gave up trying and let
him have me.  
"Okay, okay, okay!" I smiled and laughed. He smiled and laughed and pushed me
against the bed harder. I gasped. I felt his body against mine and it was
amazing. I wanted this more than anything. I wanted this more than everything.
Now...now! I ripped his shirt off and he carefully took mine off. I began to
struggle with his belt and his pants and he took off my bra. I was wearing a
skirt, so no problem, but I was still fumbling with his belt when he was
taking off my panties. "Do you have ... protection?" I breathed. He pulled
something out of his pocket and I smiled. I could barely stand it. He leaned
back and stopped everything as he let me undo his pants. I finally got them
off and pulled them down. I looked at his body and screamed. I couldn't take
this anymore. I wanted him more than I had ever wanted anyone. He was so toned
and tan...so good looking. So gorgeous. His body was amazing and I gasped as I
ran my hands over his abdomen and felt his eight pack and his pecks. He had
the triangle too, which drove me almost over the edge.  
He held me close and was breathing right in my ear. This was the most intense
thing I had ever experienced. I was moaning, even though I hadn't realized it
before. We were both sweating, and I was digging my nails into his back. His
back muscles tensed and the ecstasy was almost too much to bear. I screamed.
He sighed and let out a single moan. He fell limp onto me and we just breathed
hard for about ten minutes. Then, finally he rolled off of me and disposed of
his condom. He climbed back into bed and held me. We fell asleep cuddling;
naked. That was a bad move.  
I awoke to the front door opening. Shit, shit shit!! Who the hell was it??
"Holly?? Holly, are you home?" Shit, Fran!! Damn, girl what the hell do you
want! Don't you knock? "I knocked, but no one answered, and then the door was
open..." I guess you do. Why couldn't I hear you knocking?? Oh yeah, that's
right, you knock about as loud as a freaking mouse would! I jumped out of bed
and struggled to get my clothes on. Ryan was only in his boxers. He noticed
the fear in my eyes and jumped up also.  
What do we do?? She'll know if she sees that I'm still here! He mouthed to me.  
Closet! I mouthed back. He ran into the closet and quietly shut the door. I
shoved his clothes into my bottom drawer and took my Kleenex box and tore out
some tissues to throw into the trash can to cover the condom.  
"Holly, you up there?" I threw the sheets on the bed and tried my best to
straighten them out and fix my appearance in the mirror so I didn't have sex
hair or bed hair. Either would be a straight give away. I never sleep in the
middle of the day.  
"Yeah, come on up!" I yelled to Fran, who was already almost all the way up
the stairs. She came in my door. "Hey honey, what's up?" I said, trying to
hide the fact that I was utterly frazzled, I sat down on the bed and patted it
to signal that I wanted her to sit down too. I prayed that Ryan didn't make
any noise from the closet.  
"Hey, have you seen J.R.? He didn't come home last night."  
"No sweetie, I haven't seen him since he left yesterday." I hoped to God that
my face didn't show the guilt I felt inside. "Why, do you think something
happened to him?"  
"Oh God, no. He does this all the time, I just was wondering. Whatever, it
doesn't matter." Suddenly, I saw a sad look come over her face. I knew that
she was thinking that he didn't care about her. She was wrong. Then it hit me
like a train...that's not why she looked sad!!  
"Oh, sweetie...how'd it go with Greg? Is everything alright?" Her face
brightened. She thought I'd forgotten is all. She knew Ryan loved her. He just
worked a lot; although not last night. Then the guilt came again. I brushed it
off and tried to focus on her and not think about Ryan. "Well?"  
"It was amazing!! He really, really loves me. It was like nothing I've ever
experienced before." I sure as hell hope not, I thought to myself. "You know,
it was so special. Then we just lay there together and it was just, magic." I
smiled at her, and tried extremely hard not to picture it. She smiled back and
blushed and then giggled. Greg got her giddy the way that J.R. got me giddy.
Oh, no you don't! Don't think about him, focus on Fran. All of a sudden Fran
was staring at the floor. I didn't know what she was looking at, so I followed
her gaze down, down, down. SHIT! One of Ryan's shoes lay on the floor. She
kept staring and I tried to think of a good lie. "Hey, uh, Holly? Is that one
of my brother's shoes?" I tried to swallow and make the lump in my throat go
away. It wouldn't. We had been caught.  
"What do you mean?" I looked at her with my best fake confused face, but she
kept staring at the shoe thrown carelessly on the floor.  
"Please tell me that's one of Jack's shoes. Not just some random guy." I
jumped at the opportunity.  
"Yeah, sweetie...it's one of Jack's. It's only out because the last few days
have been very hectic for us, you know and well I just haven't had time to
clean up much." I hoped that the lie worked.  
"Uh-huh." She said. She didn't look convinced. "Well, if that's true, where's
the other shoe?" Her voice completely gave away the fact that she didn't
believe a word I was saying. She looked up at me pleadingly.  
"Oh, it's probably lying around here somewhere..." I trailed off and didn't
dare get up to pretend to start looking. I wondered if Ryan had the other shoe
in the closet with him. Oh God, please let this lie work. I know it's wrong
and horrible and I'm an awful person, but not like this. Please, not like
this. Don't let Jack find out like this! Then I just broke down and started
crying. I didn't mean to, but it just happened. "Oh, oh, oh...G-g-god!!
I-I-I'm so s-s-sorry!! I-I-I uh d-don't mean to be this much of a b-b-baby!!"
I let my head fall into my hands and just kept it there for a long while. To
my surprise, Fran got up and sat closer to me and started rubbing my back,
comforting me.  
"Aw, Holly, I'm sorry...I didn't mean to mention Jack. I know you're upset
that he's in the hospital right now and I'm just so sorry. I really didn't
mean to make you cry. I know that you love him that was stupid of me. I know
that's one of his shoes...I've seen him wear it. I'm so sorry, it's just for a
second I assumed the worst, but I know you're not like that. You would never
do my brother wrong like that. I love you Holly." I looked up at her and tried
my best to smile in between sobs. I stopped crying and wiped my eyes.  
"Thank you, Fran. I know you love me."  
"It's just that - when J.R. didn't come home last night and I had seen him
here and then you didn't answer the door and then the shoe, I just...I don't
know what I was thinking. I guess I've been watching too much Desperate
Housewives. I'm sorry." She smiled at me apologetically.  
"It's alright, sweetheart. Now, why don't you go home and see Greg and be
happy and I'll talk to you later, okay?" She nodded and left. I let out a sigh
of relief. "Okay, you can come out now," I said almost inaudibly. Ryan slowly
opened the door and walked out. He grabbed the shoe and looked at me.  
"It is Jack's. I grabbed mine before I went into the closet. I'm not a
complete idiot, you know." He looked extremely upset. He walked into my
bathroom, shut the door and turned on the radio just loud enough so he could
pretend not to hear me.  
  
  
Ryan came out of the bathroom about thirty minutes later. Steam rolled out of
the bathroom as he walked out with only a towel wrapped around his waist,
wiping his face with a hand towel. I smiled and he smiled playfully back. What
the hell am I doing? I mean, seriously. Do I love him?? I'm in love with his
brother. This isn't complicated, I swear. I laughed quietly to myself.  
"What?" He had an inquiring look on his face.  
"Nothing, just...you're cute." I giggled as he literally swept me off of my
feet. He placed me carefully on the bed, and of course off came the shirt,
bra, and panties. Jeez, this guy is a sex machine, I thought to myself. He
threw the hand towel across the room and then gently lowered himself so that
he was on top of me. I giggled and said, "ewww, you're all wet!!" He rubbed
his wet body all over me then, just to 'make me mad', even though all it did
was excite me. He slowly removed the towel from around his waist and the
expression on his face turned serious. Then, for the first time, we made true,
pure, sweet love.  
"Holly, I love you." He whispered directly into my ear immediately we had both
finished. Shit!! I thought. Now how the hell am I supposed to get out of this?
He loves me? Damn. What if I love him too?  
"I love you too," I whispered back, so gently I wondered for a second if he
had heard me. But I knew he had when he looked at me, smiled, and then kissed
me extremely passionately and said,  
"Take a shower with me." I obliged. What else was I going to do? I was already
in too deep to turn back now, so why not just enjoy it as much as I could?  
In the shower, just as we finished and I let out an ear-shattering scream, I
saw Jack's face with an expression of horror on it standing in the doorway to
OUR bathroom.  
  
  
  
I looked away and looked back. Jack's face was no longer there. It was just my
guilt. I let out a huge sigh of relief and let Ryan help me out of the shower
and dry me off. We walked into my bedroom, naked. We just couldn't help
ourselves. We loved each other's bodies. It was then I realized that Jack had
been there in the bathroom...it wasn't my guilt, because here he was sitting
on OUR bed, where Ryan and I had slept together at least three times. He
looked up at me and I noticed he had been crying. He only demanded one thing,
only asked one question,  
"Why, Holly, why?" My mouth dropped open in utter disbelief. Was this
happening? No, no it couldn't be happening. Not here, not now, not ever.
Please, God no. He turned his icy gaze towards Ryan - my Ryan - his J.R., his
brother, who had just betrayed him as much as anybody could ever betray
another person. "And YOU! HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME??!! WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
BROTHERS!!" Ryan just looked at his feet. He couldn't even look at Jack. Then
Jack ran at him. He hit him hard, harder than I had ever seen Jack hit
anybody. I was taken completely by surprise when Ryan fell to the floor
unconscious and then Jack came after me next. He hit me hard on the jaw and
then again right in my eye, and after that all I saw was blackness.  
  
  
I woke up from the dream in a cold sweat. What the - my mind was spinning.
But, but that seemed so REAL. How could it have just been a dream?? Then I
looked around my room. Everything seemed normal. Was it all a dream? Did I
ever sleep with Ryan?? My answer came soon enough. I heard a toilet flush and
then the bathroom sink water flowing and Ryan came into the room and slipped
back into bed. Damn, that coma must have really messed up my head; I'm
definitely not as sharp as I used to be. I can't believe I was so convinced
that a dream was reality. I wondered if I would ever get back to normal again.  
"Hello." I whispered to J.R. in the dark of the room.  
"Why, hello there. Who are you?" he asked playfully  
"Your brother's wife." I answered and immediately regretted it. He was silent
for a moment.  
"I should go." He said as he stood up and started dressing.  
"Ryan, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to..." He looked at me, his gaze piercing at
first, and then turned into a longing stare.  
"You just called me Ryan. I like that." He smiled.  
"Please stop smiling." I muttered inaudibly. Oh God he's gorgeous when he
smiles.  
"Huh?"  
"Nothing." I said sweetly.  
"Did you just ask me to stop smiling?" He said through another smile.  
"You weren't supposed to hear that." I laughed.  
"You don't like my smile?"  
"No! I love it, that's the problem."  
"Well, then I guess I have an advantage." He smiled and winked at me. I smiled
back at him. Why does his smile have to be so damned enticing? It was
beckoning me to walk towards him and rip his clothes off. It was such a
seductive smile, not just there for politeness; it was there to help him win
girls over. No, no, no!!! Don't let him seduce you. Not again. I stood up and
walked towards the light switch. "Aw, do you have to turn the lights on? I
kinda like them off, it's sexy." He flashed me another one of his brilliant
smiles and I was sold. I left the switch alone and instead started for the
stairs.  
"I'm going to go get something." I said with a smile.  
"What are you getting?"  
"It's a surprise."  
"What is it?"  
"Wouldn't you like to know?"  
"Yes, actually, I would."  
"Well, if I told you, then it wouldn't be a surprise now, would it?" He
chuckled quietly as I walked down the stairs. I entered the kitchen and
immediately went for the fridge. I pulled it out of one of the compartments in
the refrigerator's door and closed it. I walked over and grabbed my nicest
bottle of red wine and two glasses. Then I re-opened the fridge and grabbed
out a container. I walked back upstairs into the bathroom and grabbed about
ten candles and a lighter. I went around the bedroom and strategically placed
them, while my 'surprise' waited out in the hallway by the stairs. I lit all
of the candles and went out in the hallway and grabbed everything I had
brought up from the kitchen and walked in. "Ta-da!" I declared triumphantly.
"Here's your surprise!!" He smiled and chuckled.  
"Perfect! Strawberries, chocolate, candles and red wine. You couldn't have
done a better job if I had told you exactly what to get." He winked. This
isn't purely a physical thing anymore, it's something different. Is it love? I
sure as hell hope not. What the hell am I going to do when Jack gets out of
the hospital? Obviously, Ryan noticed the intensely concerned look on my face,
and said reassuringly, "Don't think."  
"I wish that was as easy as it sounds." I said and smiled ever so slightly. I
sat down on the bed with our wine glasses full and our strawberries and
chocolate. He leaned over and kissed me lightly. This is so romantic. Damn,
I'm good. He smiled at me and fed me a strawberry. A picture of Jack flashed
through my mind. I was immediately stricken with guilt. Why am I always caught
between guys? I closed my eyes and let out a sigh. Ryan must have known what I
was thinking, because he said,  
"I'll give you a moment," and started to get up.  
"No, no, no! Don't do that. I don't want you to go. I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to..." He looked at me and gave me a caring smile.  
"Hey, I know you haven't had a lot of time to think."  
"Yeah...I wonder why Mr. 'Don't-think'." He laughed  
"Okay, okay. Well I'm giving you time now."  
"It's a little late isn't it?" I heard footsteps coming up the stairs. I froze
with fear until they were right outside the bedroom.  
"Holly?" Oh God...Jack!  
"One minute!" I ran over and closed the door as he was pushing it open. Click.
I locked it.  
"Holly, what the-"  
"Give me a sec." I yelled. I was thinking and I had to think fast. I looked at
J.R. and motioned for him to go to the closet. He shook his head so I grabbed
his hand and ran to the bathroom. I opened the window and looked toward the
ground. It was no use. The banging on the door increased.  
"Holly!" Jack yelled.  
"Hide in the closet until we are downstairs. Then slip out." He looked at me
pleadingly. "DO it!" I ran over and opened the door as Ryan ran to the closet.
Jack frowned at me.  
"Holly what are you doing in there?"  
"Just a little...surprise. But wait! You must be tired and hungry. Let's go
downstairs."  
"Ooookkkaaayyy." Jack frowned. I grabbed his hand and led him down, noticing
his hands were more worn and sturdy than J.R.s. We went to the kitchen and I
opened the fridge, pulling out a soda and some cheese. He smiled. "Cheese?"  
"Yes, cheese. You got a problem with that?" I smiled at him, hoping he didn't
catch on to the fact that my voice was shaky.  
"No, I love it. You know why?" He looked at me and raised an eyebrow.  
"Because...you love...cheese?" Smiling and shaking his head, he said,  
"Because I love you, and I've missed you." He leaned in and kissed me gently.
That's when I noticed J.R. standing in the doorway and looking at us with
jealousy in his eyes. He turned quickly once he realized I had seen him and
walked out, slowly opening the front door so it wouldn't make any noise, and
closed it behind him. Then he was gone. I grabbed Jack's hand. "Let's go
upstairs so you can see your surprise." I led him upstairs and into our
bedroom where the strawberries, chocolate, wine and candles were still
strategically placed just where Ryan and I had left them. "Here's the
surprise!" I said, feeling more than a little guilty.  
"How sweet! But, how did you know I was coming home today?" Shit, shit...think
fast!! What could possibly be an excuse?? I know!  
"I checked with the hospital every morning to see when you would be coming
home." I smiled and motioned for him to sit down on the bed that J.R. and I
had slept together in so many times. I pushed thoughts of Ryan from my mind
and tried to focus on Jack, my husband. "Jack, sweetheart, I've missed you so
much." I put his hands on my hips and started to kiss him. God, I really do
love him. I love him so much. How could I have ever done this to him? I'll
have to tell him, I can't possibly live with the guilt. But how could I tell
him? How can I break his heart? Maybe it'll just be better if he never finds
out. Yes, it'll be much better. He never has to know.  
Weeks passed by, and life seemed to return to normal. Jack and I went to work
together, Fran and I talked, and J.R./Ryan was out of the picture. A few
times, I even forgot that anything had ever happened. My marriage to Jack was
better than ever, maybe because of my guilt, or maybe because what I did
behind his back and then having him come back home made me realize how much I
really loved him and never wanted to lose him or hurt him. Things were finally
the way they should be, at least, almost.  
  
  
"Sweetheart, what are you thinking about?" Jack looked at me over our Sunday
morning breakfast and I looked up at him to see him smiling his brilliant
smile. It reminded me of Ryan.  
"Oh, nothing. I'm just...thinking." I smiled back at him and he leaned over
the table and kissed me. He sat back down and started talking about something.
I couldn't hear a word he was saying. My head started to spin. There was an
intense pain in my back. Also, the weirdest thing; my breasts hurt. Then I
started to feel nauseated. Jack must have noticed the disgusted look on my
face.  
"Baby, what's wrong? You don't look well. Tell me what's wrong." He looked
extremely concerned, and he probably should have been. I felt like death.  
"I-I don't know exactly, I just feel really sick and I don't know why." He
gave me a look of concern again. He really does love me.  
"Do you think it was something you ate?" He caressed my hand over the table
and looked at me, waiting for an answer.  
"I don't know. It kind of feels like the onset of the flu." I grimaced.  
"Uh-oh that really wouldn't be good. Then I would have to take care of you,"
he joked. He winked at me, and when he saw that I wasn't responding, that same
concerned look came over him. "Holly, do you want me to take you to the
doctor's?" He picked up the phone and opened the phone book.  
"Yeah, I guess that'd be a good idea. You know, it never really hurts to be
extra careful. If it is the flu, I'd like to get medicine now so it doesn't
get too bad." He found our doctor's office and dialed the number into the
phone. He walked into the living room and started talking with the
receptionist. He walked back into the kitchen and announced,  
"She says you can come in now, they have a spot open and I said that we'd take
it. Are you ready to go, or do you need a minute?"  
"I can just go now. Let me clean up." He nodded and said,  
"I'll be out in the car. Hurry up, okay? I want to get this done with as soon
as possible. I don't want my baby to be sick any longer than she has to." He
smiled. I love it when he calls me 'his baby'. He walked out the front door,
and I could hear him start the car. I quickly cleaned up all the dishes and
put them in the dishwasher. I grabbed my shoes and my bag and walked out. I
got in the car and we drove off to find out what was wrong with me.  
  
  
"Well, Mrs. Paler, we don't exactly know what it is that's wrong with you,"
said Dr. Anthony Howard, one of the best doctors in the city and surrounding
areas. He was middle-aged, with thin rimmed glasses and great bed side manner.
"But, since we took some blood samples, we're going to run some tests and we
should get back to you within a few days. Why don't you leave your home phone
number with the receptionist and I'll be sure to call you once the results are
in." I smiled at him, nodded and said that I would do so. "And, just to be
safe, why don't you take a few days off of work. This ailment could be stress-
related. Since we're not sure, we want to take all the precautions and explore
all the possible causes, alright?"  
"Okay, I will. I'll just lie back for a few days. Although, I can only take
three sick days right now. Is that okay?"  
"Yes, that should be fine. I should be back to you with the results by then.
Until then, like you said, just lie back and let your husband take extra good
care of you." He smiled and winked at me. "Now, if you start to feel worse,
come back and visit us immediately."  
"Alright, thank you, Doctor." I smiled and he left the room so I could put my
clothes back on. Jack had been in the room the whole time, but hadn't said
much. He didn't particularly favor doctors.  
On the way home, Jack and I were both silent. He was holding my hand and
stroking it gently. I knew he was concerned, and honestly, so was I. When we
got home, I went directly upstairs to lie in bed. I really wasn't feeling
well. A few minutes later, Jack came upstairs with a wet cloth and a bucket of
lukewarm water. He put the cloth on my forehead and started stroking my hair.
Then, he decided to lie next to me and put his arms around me. He started
kissing my neck. I put the cloth on the nightstand and the bucket on the floor
next to the bed. We started kissing passionately, and one thing led to
another, and before I knew it, we were making love.  
Afterwards, Jack fell asleep, but I didn't feel any better and couldn't sleep.
Thoughts of J.R. kept entering my mind. Soon, I began to cry softly. I cried
myself to sleep that day.  
  
When I woke up, Jack was gone. It was eight o'clock at night. What is wrong
with me? I got up and went to the bathroom. I washed my face and began to
brush my teeth. After about a minute of brushing my teeth, an unbelievable
wave of nausea came over me and I had to drop my toothbrush and run to the
toilet. Then, I did something I hadn't done in a very long time. I vomited.
What the hell? I guess this really is the flu. But, if so, why didn't the
doctor find any apparent symptoms?  
I went downstairs to find Jack sitting in the living room. "Jack, something's
really wrong with me. I just vomited." He jumped up immediately with a look of
shock on his face.  
"Oh my God, Holly, are you alright?!" He came over to me and started hugging
me.  
"I feel alright now, but I think that something is really wrong with me, and I
don't know what it is. Not knowing is killing me." Jack walked into the
kitchen.  
"Do you feel like having dinner?" He called to me from the kitchen store room,
where we kept all of our food that didn't have to be refrigerated.  
"Uh, not really. I don't think I could keep anything down." I called back.  
"Well, you should really have something. Sit down and relax, and I'll make you
something yummy." I smiled. He was so cute. I loved it when he said things
like that. Yummy. What a funny word. I plopped down on the couch and heard him
rattling around in the kitchen. A few minutes later, he came out with a TV
tray. On it was a bowl of chicken noodle soup, water, and a spoon. "It's good
for upset tummies." He smiled and I giggled.  
"Tummies? What am I, four?" He laughed and set the tray down on the coffee
table in front of me.  
"Hey, don't make fun of me, just eat the soup." He smiled and sat down across
from me.  
"What about you, aren't you eating?"  
"Baby, it's eight thirty at night. I already fixed myself something to eat at
around seven thirty." He smiled and watched me eat some of the soup. "How's
the soup?" He asked.  
"It's very good, thank you." He came over and lovingly stroked me on the head.
He walked into the kitchen and I could hear him cleaning up. I finished the
soup and brought the tray into the kitchen. He took it, smiled, and began to
clean the dishes and put everything else away. "I'm going to go to bed. Join
me soon, okay?" He nodded and kissed me on the cheek; with that I walked
upstairs and took a quick shower. I brushed my teeth and successfully finished
this time. I changed into my pajamas, climbed into bed, and turned off the
light. A while later, Jack joined me and kissed me before I fell asleep.  
The next morning I woke up to a note on Jack's pillow.  
  
Went out to get some good breakfast.  
Be back soon. I love you!  
-Jack   
  
I was busy getting ready when the phone rang.  
"Hello?" I said into the receiver.  
"Hello, is this Mrs. Paler?" A male voice asked.  
"Yes, this is she."  
"Mrs. Paler, hello. This is Dr. Howard. I have your test results." There was a
sinking feeling in my stomach. I really didn't want the results to be bad. I
hoped I wasn't dying of some strange disease. I really didn't want a new
disease to be named after me, the way that they'll name new diseases after the
people they're found in or the places they're found in. 'Holly Paler Disease',
that would be a God-awful name.  
"Oh? And?"  
"I have some very good news!" I sighed. Thank God, nothing's wrong with me.
"Mrs. Paler, you're not sick at all." Phew. "As a matter of fact, you're
pregnant!"  
"I'm sorry, I'm what?" I was breathless. I couldn't think, and had trouble
forming the words.  
"You're pregnant, Mrs. Paler! I hope that you and your husband are very happy
together with your new baby! I have to go, I have an appointment coming, but
congratulations to you both! Goodbye, Mrs. Paler."  
"Goodbye, Dr. Howard, and thank you." And with that, Dr. Howard hung up the
phone, and the world went black.  
  
My mind wouldn't stop working. It was almost like it was working in overtime.
Thoughts kept running through my head, and I didn't know exactly what to
think. Is this good or bad? And then the one question I didn't want to ask
myself, yet maybe the one most important question I would ever ask myself,
Whose is it? I had to sit down. I collapsed on the couch in the living room
and tried to calm myself. How could this happen? J.R. and I used protection.
Did Jack and I? No, we're married and trying to have kids, of course we
wouldn't. Then it's Jack's, right? The baby is Jack's...it has to be. With the
end of that thought came the familiar sound of a key turning in our front
door's lock. Jack was home. What to do? What if the doctor had called him? I
needed some time to collect my thoughts and try to find a way to explain
myself. I didn't have any time. Jack was home and was going to want me to tell
him what the doctor had said. He would know that the doctor had called since
we had caller ID. Great, what the hell do I say? I can't say anything until I
know for sure, can I? Oh, Jesus, God in Heaven please help me. I can get a
paternity test and see whose baby it is. But then, what if it is Ryan's baby?
I had to stop thinking about J.R. because Jack walked into the kitchen where
the main phone ID machine was and started clicking away, checking who had
called while he was at work.  
"Holly?" His familiar voice drifted out from the kitchen. I gulped and tried
once again to swallow the huge lump in my throat. It was an unsuccessful
attempt. "I see that Dr. Howard called, what did he have to say? Do they know
what it is yet?" He walked into the doorway that led into the living room and
looked at me.  
"Yes, Dr. Howard did call. He said that I'm not sick at all." I smiled weakly
at him and tried to make the world stop spinning.  
"Well, then, does he know what made you feel so awful? Was it stress related?"
He looked concerned again. Unfortunately, I was the one that needed to be
concerned.  
"He said that it wasn't stress either." I gulped again and hoped the next
inevitable question wouldn't come.  
"Holly, did he say what the hell it was then?" He sat down on the ataman. God,
why did you have to sit there? That's where J.R. always sat. You two are
unbelievably alike. Damnit.  
"He said that...well, that..."  
"What, Holly?! Spit it out!" He was obviously getting tired of me beating
around the bush.  
"Well, it appears that...I'm pregnant." With that he let out a horrifically
loud whooping sound and started jumping around the living room.  
"THAT'S AMAZING, HOLLY!! WE'RE PREGNANT!! WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BABY!! YOU AND
I, SWEETHEART!! WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A FAMILY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Damnit, could he
have had a better reaction? In any other situation, that would have been just
the reaction I was looking for, but how could I be excited if the baby could
quite possibly be his brother's?  
I had to get a paternity test. The question of fatherhood would drive me
insane. Should I tell Ryan before or after I get the test? Should I let him
know that I'm pregnant now? No, I don't think that I will, because that would
make him worry possibly for nothing. I'll tell him after I get the test done.
I have to make an appointment NOW. I waited until Jack went to bed that night
and then sifted through the phone book and put it into the car with me, a
bookmark marking the page where I could find the number for the clinic. I had
to drive to a phone booth about an hour away. There was no way I was going to
risk using my cell phone, let alone the house phone. Jack could look through
the calls and find out that I had contacted a clinic and would know that I had
cheated on him.  
"Hi, yeah I was wondering if I could make an appointment, I need to get a
paternity test." We set up an appointment for the next day. I crept inside the
house and pulled out a Q-tip from our bathroom. Jack was sleeping with his
mouth open, no surprise there. I gently swabbed the inside of his cheek and
put the cotton swab in a small vile. He coughed a little and turned over.
Phew...again. I hid the vile in my purse under a tampon. He'll never look past
that. I climbed into bed and he automatically put his arms around me.  
"I'm so sorry Jack." I whispered to him. He groaned a little and moved closer.  
  
I woke up when Jack did the next morning. And he smiled at me. I squinted and
stuck out my tongue at him.  
"You're really not a morning person."  
"I have to be- I married you."  
"I wouldn't have it any other way." I forced a smile but inside I was dying.  
"When will we tell your father?"  
"My--- Father?" I snorted. "Yeah...real soon!" I stated sarcastically.  
"Don't you want to tell your parents?"  
No. "Yes! Eventually. I have to go."  
"Where."  
"To the doctors."  
"Count me out."  
"I have- bye!" I yelled over my shoulder as I grabbed my purse and ran to my
car. My appointment was in two hours. But I drove anyway, and found myself in
front of Ryan's apartment building. I got out and went upstairs to his floor,
went to his door, and lifted my hand. It hovered there for a second, but soon
enough, knocked. A sleepy J.R. answered the door but woke up when he saw me.  
"What-"  
"I don't know. I just had to see you."  
"Want to come in?"  
"Yeah." I walked inside. "Fran?" I called  
"She's at school." I looked up at his eyes and instantly was hooked. He was
like a drug. We only stood there looking at each other for a minute and
practically jumped each other. I literally jumped on him and he caught me and
backed me up into a wall.  
"J.R?" I heard a woman's voice from his bedroom. He pulled away from me and
put me down. We stood looking at each other for a second. He walked over to
his bedroom and closed the door. "J.R?" I heard the whiny voice again.  
"Be right there." He shouted. I ran over to him and pushed him up against a
wall. I didn't blame him, but I could not say I wasn't jealous. He ran his
hands up and down my back softly, and spun me around so I was against the
wall. "I still love you, that hasn't changed." He whispered as I kissed his
neck. "It kills me when I think of you and my brother together." The phone
rang. "One sec." He said. "Hello? Hey bro." Oh God no. "WHAT? I mean
congratulations..." I ran over and pushed the button to cut the line. He
looked at me.  
"I was going to tell you."  
"WHEN?" he yelled.  
"After I got a paternity test."  
"No, that's not possible. I used protection."  
"Not that one time in the shower, or the whip cream night, or-"  
"Okay!" He cried "I get it. What are we-"  
"I don't even know if its yours." I said casually.  
"Alright. No need to freak out for no good reason."  
"That's why I didn't want to tell you." He looked at me for a sec. then looked
away. "Ryan, look at me." I whispered. He did. He was gorgeous. Before I knew
it we were kissing again and knocking things over.  
"J.R? Who is this?" a blond with big boobs was leaning on the door frame.  
"This is Holly."  
"How do you know her?"  
"She's my brother's wife..." he mumbled very quietly.  
"Well- good luck with that." She said and walked quickly out of the apartment.
I looked at my watch. I only had a half an hour.  
"I have to go!" I said frantically and tried to run out the door. He grabbed
me and kissed me. I tried again, with the same results. Finally I broke away
and managed to get to my car, and finally to the clinic.  
  
"Hi. I'm Holly Paler, here to get a paternity test."  
"Oh, Mrs. Paler, Dr. Mordison will be right with you- come this way." She led
me to a room that smelled like ammonia and was completely white with no
pictures. It had very little furniture but some creepy looking instruments.
Dr. Mordison was a tall man with dark hair that was slightly balding on the
top. He had dark eyes and an expressionless face. How creepy can this place
be?  
"Do you understand the risks of this Mrs. Paler?" His voice was deep and
scratchy.  
"Not really."  
"You could have a miscarriage, vaginal bleeding and cramps."  
"Well. I need to know. I just need to."  
"Very well then. Let's get started." I won't go into details but it was
uncomfortable.  
"Listen can I just give you my husband's DNA?"  
"That's acceptable. Just give it to the receptionist. We'll have the results
in a couple of days."  
"Thank you." I paid quickly and left, the place was very creepy.  
  
I stopped my car outside of my house and took a few deep breaths. I needed to
clear my head. So I went to work. I walked into my office seeing Mitch there.
Mitch was young and he was under my care, I had much to teach him anyway.  
"Wow. Holly, you're uhhh here."  
"Yeah. Give me an assignment, I have a lot to catch up on."  
"Aren't you supposed to be home?" How many people could Jack possibly tell?  
"No, it's fine. Give me an assignment."  
"I'm sorry I can't. Chief's orders."  
"Chief?" I almost screeched.  
"Yeah" I was halfway out the door before he could finish.  
I stormed into my father's office, slamming down the newspaper he was reading.  
"Honey!" he looked surprised. "Now shouldn't you be home?"  
"NO!" I screamed.  
"Holly, what in the world is wrong?"  
"I want to work daddy."  
"Our field of work is far too dangerous for an expecting mother."  
"Jack. He told you?"  
"Poor boy couldn't keep his mouth shut around the office, when someone came in
congratulating me on being a grandfather I had no idea..." I turned and
stormed out of his office the same way he came in. I went to the armory and
looked in the training room (one way window), Jack was in there with his rush
force, teaching them in the virtual world how to fight undetected crime. His
vest was on and I watched as he yelled to his troops, them running in all
different directions, he held up his gun and shot at something virtual. I
could see his arm muscles working and the sweat on his body as he did it. He
was so good at what he was doing. I felt my heartbeat- it had increased since
I had been watching him. I spun looking at a red light, security breech. The
sirens went off and the training room stopped activity and they stopped with
it. I sprang into action grabbing a gun, pulling on my vest and running down
the hall. I turned into my office.  
"Mitch?"  
"Some mob guy has a hostage." I ran down the hall to the central wing to the
commons room. There he was, holding a gun to the hostage's head. I knew the
hostage. Greg.  
"Just the girl I was looking for." It was Anthony, one of Mick's cohorts.  
"What do you want?"  
"Your baby."  
  
My head spun. "But, how do you know?"  
"Oh come on Holly- we've been watching."  
"You can't have our baby!" Jack yelled from the back of the crowd. Anthony
threw Greg and grabbed me pressing the gun to my head. I felt dizzy.  
"Oh, but haven't you heard Jack? The baby might not be yours."  
  
Jack stopped and looked dumbfounded.  
"Jack, don't listen to him." He looked at me with a look of unconceivable hurt
in his eyes. "Don't you listen to him. This child is ours. Yours and mine." He
nodded at me and smiled. Anthony howled with rage.  
"That's it? You're going to believe her?" he yelled  
"Yeah. I am." He leveled a gun at Anthony's head. "And if you don't release my
wife, you'll be dead." He pushed me to the ground and Jack lowered his gun, he
always kept his word. I watched in slow motion as Anthony raised the gun and
aimed at my husband. I jumped up in front of him and kneed him as his gun went
off; he doubled over; the bullet hitting me at point blank range in the
stomach even though I had managed to jump halfway to the side. I felt fire go
up and down my abdomen, searing pain as I tried to gasp for breath. I only saw
black and red, when I opened my eyes Anthony was being overwhelmed and I felt
like I wasn't in my body, I couldn't feel my limbs or extremities.  
"Oh God, Holly...baby, can you hear me?" I saw Jack's handsome features above
me, a look of pure terror engulfing them. I nodded and everything went black.  
  
"I'm sorry Mrs. Paler, you've lost the baby." I was sitting on the couch with
the paternity test in my hands, doctor's words echoing in my head. I could
stand it no longer and I ripped open the results with trembling fingers.  
Paternal Father: Jack Paler. I gasped and felt silent hot tears running down
my face. Jack came down and smiled at me.  
"I knew you'd convert." It was seven in the morning.  
"Don't go patting yourself on the back Mr. Paler." I stated.  
"And why not may I ask?"  
"Because it was the coffee and nothing else that converted me."  
"Oh. You're charming, larger than life husband had nothing to do with it?  
"Nope."  
"Well than. If I can't influence you that way I guess I'll just have to
influence you in other ways." He said mischeiviously.  
  
I came to in the hospital. Jack was beside me. I still couldn't move. How can
they be controlling me? Then I saw the nurse. Melinda. She was injecting me
with it! I looked around at the damage. Only my arm was broken.  
"Oh, come on honey. Tell your husband that you're okay." She demanded.  
"She's right. I'm okay." I said.  
"I'll be back with another injection...stay here!"  
I frantically searched for another connection...I just needed- found it! I
widened my eyes toward Melinda. Jack caught it, but the nurse seemed
oblivious. When she left, he moved me to a storage room and locked the door.
Now we just had to wait.  
"What's wrong?" Jack asked. He didn't know I couldn't talk. I groaned.
"Holly?" He looked worried. My finger moved. In my mind, I told my finger to
move again. It did. The drug is wearing off! Other limbs started working. My
heart was racing. In the hall I heard people running around.  
"Where is she?" I heard her cry as other joined in her search. I heard her
knock on the door. "Hello? Hello? It's locked! She's in here! She needs her
medication injection!"  
My mouth moved and I tested my voice. Nothing yet. People were pounding on the
glazed window with various objects.  
"Where's a janitor? We need a key!"  
"Jack!" I squeaked. "It's the nurse. She's Mick's wife, she used drugs on me
and Greg; she wants us eliminated and Greg to be part of their mob, so he
won't tell the police what he knows. She wanted me to kill you, but I threw
myself into the street. When they get in, hide, I'll pretend like I'm still
drugged, but whatever you do, assume I'm on the drugs." He kissed me quickly
and searched for a way out as the key in the keyhole unlocked the door. He
crawled in the air vent and the metal door lock clicked behind him. The
janitor walked away as people rushed in.
