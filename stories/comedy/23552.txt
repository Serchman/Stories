Prologue

**So cute, so innocent; they seem so harmless, they always do at first; with their cute little noses twitching, that little cotton tail, those little pointy ears, and those big innocent eyes. It’s all a trick. They are monsters, killers! They lead you on, draw you in, then they strike! I'm talking about one of the most devious creatures alive on this world. Bunnies.**

**But not just any ordinary bunnies, oh no these are much worse. They are DEMON BUNNIES!! I know what you’re thinking; you think I’m crazy now don’t you?! Just like everyone else! I know you do! Don’t try to lie to me!!... (I know everything...)**

**They are vicious, evil, and demonic creatures!! So worry little girls, worry. They are not as cute and cuddly as they seem ... though there was this one girl who was really messed up... we’ll get to that later. Little girls they are not, I repeat they are not, cute and cuddly little bunnies! But no one in their right mind should think these things are cute! They will try to kill you, murder you, and eat you!**

**I wrote this to warn you about the horrible danger that no one seems to see, and stop it before it’s too late!! If you do not stop it now, they will rule the world!! Taking over your minds, putting you under their undeniable control! Making you their slaves for all time, or till they end up eating you. They’ll start with one village at a time, next large towns, then kingdoms, countries, the world! You must stop them before they can get a foot hold on the world! You must prevent this from happening!! If you don’t they will destroy the human race! Humans would be obsolete, and obliterated! All of humanity will no longer exist! ALL OF US WILL BE DESTROYED! STOP THE DEMON BUNNIES STOP THEM BEFORE IT IS-** (**_Hello sorry about that, I’m the Co-Author. I had to knock her out before she started ranting on for another 50 pages, and I would have to listen to her for the next 5 hours. So for now I’ll take over the story till she wakes up in... Oh 2 hours [Maybe I hit her bit harder then I meant to]. For now I will share my non biased point of view on... is that a Demon Bunny?! Is she honestly messed up enough to cage a Demon Bunny?! Why on earth would she keep a caged rabid Demon Bunny inside her house, it is almost as bad as her...._**

**_But that’s beside the point. We-I- are trying to warn you about Demon Bunnies. So let the story begin. _**
