The undead employees in his office didn't make Isaac panic. The Human Resource
manager quickly ascended the nearest bookcase, the one containing files a650
to c1278. The unliving started to besiege him there, making guttural sounds
and clawing gestures.  
Isaac considered his options. He could either jump from bookcase to bookcase
and possibly find safety that way. Or he could throw himself through the
window to plummet towards the asphalt ten stories below. Or he could join the
employees.  
His decision was made for him when the bookcase toppled over and he became one
of them..  
A month later the insects ate them all.
