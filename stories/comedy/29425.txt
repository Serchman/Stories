# Jumper

by Alexis Kypridemos**  
**

The man stood on the ledge, threatening suicide.

"Don’t move or I’m going to jump!" he called to the firemen collected thirty
stories below.

"Don’t do it!" the fire marshal called up. "Everything’s going to be OK."

"I’m going to do it, I swear!"

"Think about your family!"

"Nuts to my family!"

"OK! If you come down... we’ll get you some pussy!"

"Really?"

"Absolutely."

"You wouldn’t be kidding me, would you?"

"Never."

"Can you get me a Puerto Rican chick? I always wanted to score with a Puerto
Rican chick."

"I’ll do what I can."

"You do that. I think I’ll come down now."

The window behind the man opened, knocking him to the ground.

"Aiiiieeeee!"

Detectives Richard "Dick" Tuggs and David "Davie" Croquet peered out onto the
ledge.

"I thought there was a suicide threat in progress," Croquet said.

"I don’t see anything."

"I guess he changed his mind."

"You see how things work out sometimes?"

"Yeah, I guess you’ve got to believe in people-"

A female voice above them screamed, "Up here! Help me!"

"On the roof!" Tuggs said.

They drew their guns and ran to the stairs.

Moments later, they burst through the door onto the roof, guns drawn. A man
held a blonde girl hostage, a gun pointed at her head.

"Put the gun down!" Tuggs ordered.

"No way, pig," the gunman said. "I want a plane. And I want a car to get me to
the airport. And I want ten million dollars. Then I’ll think about letting the
girl go."

"The plane, where do you want it to take you?" Tuggs asked.

"Bahamas. The Grand Imperial hotel. I want the Presidential suite, with full
room service. And I want mints on my pillow!"

"You’re going to have to give us some time. I don’t know about the mints on
the pillow."

"Don’t kid me, man! I know you can do that!"

He tightened his grip around the girl.

"OK, just calm down-"

Bang! Croquet shot the girl. She stumbled backwards and fell off the roof. The
gunman looked on, dumbfounded.

"You- you-"

Tuggs took advantage of the gunman's momentary confusion. He grabbed the gun
out of his hand and threw him to the ground. Planting a foot between his
shoulder blades, he slipped cuffs onto his wrists.

Croquet walked over, holstered his gun.

"Smart move," Tuggs said to him. "Going for the hostage first. Disorienting
the perp."

Croquet nodded. "The trick is to aim for the perp."
