**Day 1:** Captain’s Log, stardate twenty-two point five, rounded off to the nearest decimal point. Our small platoon, twenty-four men, arrived in what was formerly called New Jersey today. And I thought this place smelled bad on the outside. Just like Saigon! We’re officially in Injun country now. The men are green; none of them have any combat or military experience. I, their leader, Captain Compost, myself have no combat experience or training either. However, we’ve all extensively played first person shooters and _Command and Conquer_, so we think that pretty much covers it and we’ll be fine. We’re loaded out with Ruger Mini-14 rifles, AMT Hardball M1911 pistols, and Gerber LMF II knives. One of our number carries a Remington 700 bolt action rifle. We should be receiving our mission from High Command shortly via messenger pigeon. The nuclear blast at the start of the war wiped out phone and internet coverage in this area, so messenger pigeon is one of few reliable methods of communication left. It worked in World War Part One, right?

Captain's Log, stardate twenty-four point nine and three-fourths rounded off
to the nearest decimal point. Orders…received…we're...setting out to save a
group of POWs (prisoners of war) held... DEEP within Injun country… SO FAR...
no... signs of friendly life, but we’re going to find them. If we have to nuke
this area of the country AGAIN, we’re going to find it! We've... GOT TO,
MISTER!

**Day 2:** Captain’s Log, stardate twenty-eight point two, rounded off to the nearest decimal point. Just as it was getting dark today we came upon a group of the “enemy,” there were about thirty of them and they got the jump on us, coming upon us unexpectedly as we crossed a tranquil stream. Fortunately, they were “one shots.” One shots being people who shoot once and only once because they consider firing two or more shots to be “excessive!,” “reeediciulous!!!,” and “totally uncalled for!” Yep, they don’t believe in magazine dumping, praying and spraying, shooting and scooting or even sniping and griping. They also believe in only firing one shot when practicing at the firing range as they never plan on shooting more than one shot in actual combat. Thusly, the single shots the lot of them fired at us all missed as naturally they were terrible marksmen. We promptly returned fire and wiped them out to the last, firing as many shots as we liked. It was a short affair. We wondered what they were doing out here, they were all dressed in fashionable, brightly colored neon clothing. One was wearing a glowing lime green business suit, backwards. Aside from shouts of “FIRST KILL,” SKULL BUSTER,” “BOOM HEADSHOT,” and “IMMORTAL” during the shootout, our impossibly young platoon (average age, 19) acquitted themselves well.

**Day 3:** Captain’s Log, stardate twenty-one point three, rounded off to the nearest decimal point. We slept late, not really fearing an attack after the enemy’s pathetic display yesterday. Our resident sharpshooter, who once was a speedrunner of the video game _Duck Hunt_, took one of our men as a spotter and went off on his own mission to disrupt enemy operations and inspire terror within their ranks. I let him go as High Command said we should take any available opportunity to cause additional damage to enemy forces (and their morale) as was feasible. We started marching around noon; we were only on the road for about an hour when we came upon one of our own POW camps. Both sides in this here Second American Civil War keep their POW camps in former New Jersey as the lingering radiation from nuclear blast at the start of the conflict emasculates the prisoners, making them weak and lazy. There’ve been no escape attempts so far on either side. Anyway, the POW camp was bursting, filled to capacity, all the men had their hands broken so they were deprived the pleasure of masturbation. In the administrative segregation section, the men further had their feet broken (so as to prevent foot jobs) and their jaws broken (so as to prevent added situational homosexuality). There no women in the camps, at least not as prisoners. Nope, they all were happily working away at the camps on our side. Many female POWs work in our offices at forward command posts around the nation. We never worry about or question their loyalty, women _alwayssss_ side with the conquering army. I heard a famous German fighter ace in World War Part Two was soooo worn out from having sexual intercourse with collaborating French women that some days he just couldn’t fly; he just couldn’t get it up (no pun intended). I further heard that before the war, women represented most of the new converts to Mohammedanism, imagine that! Anywho, after passing the camp and having a good laugh at the POWs expense, we continued on as usual.

**Day 4:** Captain’s Log, stardate twenty-three point three, rounded off to the nearest decimal point. We came upon an entrenched enemy position early this morning. They were visible from several miles off due to their vibrantly colored “camouflage.” We approached cautiously at first, but then just charged right in when we realized they didn’t have any firearms on them. See, they were only armed with Tasers and pepper spray because they didn’t believe in deadly force and thought non-lethal force actually works. Harmless harm, forceless force, makes sense right? Well they fired their Tasers when we were about two hundred yards off despite those Tasers only having a range of six feet and taking forever to reload. Then they fired pepper spray at us when we were about a hundred yards off, but that stuff only has a range of twenty-five yards. We ran right up to them till we were about ten yards off, looking down into their trench. They were out of the pepper spray by now, having shot their wad when we were still out of range. We hosed them down and there were no survivors. Their lot was a sad one, effeminate men, teenage girls, old bingo bag ladies, midgets, obese persons of all ages, people undergoing hormone therapy, and others who were not suited to combat conditions or warfare in the slightest. I’m surprised some of this lot didn’t kill themselves during the mass suicides that occurred at the start of the war when the power went out for a solid month and the food shortages started. There was no fast food for months! We threw some dirt on top of the trench, making it a grave for the group, and said a few words of prayer from a pocket Bible. We knew that a proper Christian burial would offend them if they were still alive, that’s why we did it. Christians were officially sanctioned by the government as the only religious group it was okay to make fun of in the run up to the war. Who’s laughing now? I wonder…

**Day 5:** Captain’s Log, stardate twenty-one point seven, rounded off to the nearest decimal point. We came upon an absolutely awful sight today a few hours into our march. We had spotted a vine covered McMansion on a hilltop and decided to investigate it for anything of intelligence value. In the living room we found six decaying human corpses, a family from the looks of it. They had starved to death apparently. Their cell phones were still grasped in their hands, still blinking with unanswered notifications. They were laid out on six separate couches. At first, we thought they died as one of the countless casualties of the food shortages. However, upon inspecting the kitchen we discovered they had a huge walk-in pantry filled with food of all varieties. It was rotting and unusable now, but given the stage of decay the corpses were at, it should have been fit for consumption while they were still alive. We did find two gossip magazines on the floor of the pantry, one dated 2007 was headlined, “Hulk Hogan is suicidal.” Another dated 2015 also had the headline, “Hulk Hogan is suicidal.” Hmm. There was no note indicating a suicide pact by this group via starvation or anything, so the only conclusion can be they loved their phones so much they neglected to eat until they literally starved to death. I’d say it was sad, but really, what a bunch of narcissistic Immanuel Kants! Reminds me of the first few months of the war, people were committing suicide by the dozen when the power grid went out, my favorite burger joint closed down because people kept sticking their heads in the ovens. People were desperate for internet and phone coverage, they sold their kids, sold sex, sold food (during a food shortage nonetheless!), even sold their organs….the ones that you need and use! The power grid going out for so long caused more casualties than the nuclear strikes, the food shortages, and the Civil War up to this point combined! In other news our sniper team reported via messenger pigeon of their success today. They set up a suitcase full of wires and circuit boards on a well-traveled road, then waited for some of the enemy to gather around it. They thought it was a clock despite it having no face or hands and not being able to tell time and looking like an improvised explosive device. When a sufficient crowd had gathered our crackshot detonated the “clock,” sending body parts hurtling through the air in a puff of black smoke. Just before the explosion the enemy group was arguing amongst themselves about whether the device was a clock or not, the deniers being ridiculed as “prejudiced against clocks” and “clock bigots.” The sniper team reported further success by leaving a faux iPhone out in the open, then waiting for curious enemies to come by and pick it up, blasting them just as they do. They got ten of them that way, yes, even with corpses strewn around it, they still kept coming for that phone, not believing their impossible luck, finding a brand new iPhone amidst post-apocalyptic “New Jersey.” You can’t write this stuff.

**Day 6:** Captain’s Log, stardate nineteen point seven, rounded off to the nearest decimal point. We camped for the night upon that hilltop; the smell wasn’t too bad when the wind blew. At daybreak we climbed down. We were just a few hundred yards past the hill when we came upon a heavily fortified enemy position, some sort of concrete structure with a thatch roof made of twigs over it. Guns stuck out of small firing ports made in the concrete. The concrete structure was covered with incomprehensible graffiti, all done up in flashy colors; this kind of negated their camouflaged roof. With the platoon being too far away from our own lines for artillery support, our airplanes grounded due to a fuel shortage (sidenote: Fuck OPEC), and reinforcements a few days march away, I talked it over with the men before making any attack decision. They unanimously agreed that we should just charge in firing because we have extra lives and auto-regenerating health, right? Of course, I told them (remember, troop morale is always #1)! Off we charged whilst occasionally stopping to fire off a few rounds. Surprisingly, there was some return fire from the enemy this time. However, they were only aiming for our legs, believing that someone hit in the legs will immediately lose the will to fight and instantly give up. This has worked in tons of movies, so in hypothetical movie theory it works, right? Well, wrong, President Bush! They missed our skinny flailing legs as we ran at a high rate of speed towards them and our platoon didn’t suffer one casualty. Not even a graze wound. Upon reaching the bunker, we easily climbed its walls being strapping young men and all, then fired down on them through the twig roof; others of our number covered the sides and back of the bunker, cutting off any escape. After a substantial amount of firing, there was a lull. From the dark silence of the bunker, we heard a voice whine, “I was turning my life arounddddddddddddd” before then hearing the crisp pop of a single gunshot. You do the math.

**Day 7:** Captain’s Log, stardate twenty-five point one, rounded off to the nearest decimal point. We almost had it today. Our little platoon was shaving their peachfuzz (those of us that can grow peachfuzz, that is) with their knives in a polluted brook when a whole platoon of the enemy stumbled upon us. Again they were all decked out gaudily and again they looked like people not too suited for combat or wilderness survival or exercise or regular toilet use. Fortunately, they were part of the “oh they only have knives/knives count as they’re unarmed and thus totally harmless since they don’t have a gun” school of thought and henceforth did not open fire and take us all right there though they effortlessly could have. Instead they just yelled at us in their emaciated voices, stuff like: “Stop!” “Freeze!” “Go home!” “Waaahhh!” “It’s Christmas people!” They ended all their sentences with the phrase “hashtag Second American Civil War.” Well anyway, after a few seconds of being stuck in a Mexican standoff with the lot of them, I ordered our platoon to charge them with their knives only. They didn’t shoot us because we “only had knives” and were thus “harmless.” Well they all got OJ’ed, so to speak. I went after their “leader,” he/she/he or she or both, was wearing an “RIP Cecil” shirt. I think this was first bayonet charge on the American continent since the FIRST American Civil War. We did take one prisoner, a mournful bodybuilding, muscle milk drinking bro who says he only went along with them to “show his sensitive side” and because “they had a better gym.” We broke his hands and sent him off back towards our lines with orders to turn himself in to the first patrol he comes across. I felt no pity or sympathy for him, I think people like him are part of the reason we lost the last few wars with the Mohammedans. Our armies were too focused on who could do the most push-ups, sit-ups, run the most miles, do the most bicycles, etc. when really what was handicapping our troops was not a lack of push-ups, but a lack of sense and sensibility among the leadership. After a terrorist attack on an Army base a few years before the war started, some General, who probably liked push-ups, said in his strawman argument that diversity shouldn’t be a casualty of the attack (since the attacker was a Mohammedan who tricked the Army for two decades). Well, no one said it should be, they just said when a soldier says he is Mohammedan first and a soldier, an American, and a humanist a vastly distant second maybe that should raise more than an eyebrow. There were eight attacks on US military installations in the next six years; it’s no wonder they lasted shorter than a virgin at a whorehouse once this war started.

**Day 8:** Captain’s Log, stardate twenty-nine point eight, rounded off to the nearest decimal point. Our quest is at an end, today we “liberated” the POWs we set out to rescue. I say “liberated” in quotes because while we overwhelmed the camp, we did not free them. The opposition’s POW camps are twice as brutal as ours, prisoners spend all day watching football on giant television screens and doing nothing else, save for making brilliant and extremely intelligent comments like, “he _should _have caught that” and “they need to _score_ on this play,” and even, “this is a _must-win_ game.” There are no guards or security measures and all prisoners wear homemade sports jerseys as their uniforms. We tried to break them out of their trance, we told them it was all fake, the games were rigged, the seasons scripted, and the players all on steroids too. We pointed out how three summers after “The Fappening” just before this whole Second American Civil War deal really took off, an internet hacking scandal revealed professional football to be a massive fraud orchestrated with the assistance of the government to assure a passive, distracted, and compliant population (and provided ample evidence of such). They wholeheartedly refused to believe us, they were all too happy in their cages, I guess. They steadfastly declined to leave the camp and be free to the point of physically attacking us when we attempted to turn the giant screens off. One of our men shot a POW dead in frustration, only to be flabbergasted himself when none of the man’s fellow POWs showed any emotion, neither concern nor care nor sadness or fear over the event and instead stayed glued to the big screen. Dejected, our morale at an all-time low, we left the camp after sending a messenger pigeon to High Command regarding our findings. One of our men, who had recognized his father and brother amidst the POWs, cried softly to himself as the platoon silently trod back through the dead bracken. Captain’s Log, signing off.
