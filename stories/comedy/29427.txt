# Crescendo

by Alexis Kypridemos

Stuart Thrasher sat perched on his stool, waiting, as he had been for the
previous ninety minutes. A bead of sweat dripped from his forehead, down his
cheek, onto the rim of his tuxedo collar, tickling him. But he dared not
release the vice-like grips he held on his cymbals to reach for his collar.
Instead he used all his will power to ignore the tickling sensation. After
all, he had spent his entire adult life preparing for this sort of thing.

He listened attentively. Yes, there was the swell in volume from the strings,
the subtle underpinning from the clarinet... There it was! There was his cue!

On the next down beat, Thrasher stood up and crashed his cymbals together
triumphantly, giving him a rush that vindicated the previous ninety minutes of
inactivity.

A great noise covered the delicate sound of the symphony orchestra, as a
section of the audience erupted in applause. "Yeeeeah! Way to go Stuie!" some
shouted as they clapped, while others whistled. Confused, the conductor
stopped conducting. The orchestra stopped playing.

Thrasher felt a little embarrassed at the overwhelming response from his loyal
fans, but equally felt that he should express his gratitude, so he stood up
and gave a short bow.

The conductor followed the audience's gaze to the top of the orchestra pit. He
got off his podium to get a better look at the percussion section.

"Right," he said. "Who's Stuie? You?" He pointed a finger at Thrasher. The
cymbalist nodded sheepishly.

"Out!"

Thrasher left his stool and walked off the stage red-faced, like a reprimanded
schoolboy.
