Life just gets better as you get older doesnt it.

  

  

  

I was in a Starbucks Coffee recently when my stomach started rumbling and I
realized that I desperately needed to fart. The place was packed but the music
was really loud so to get relief and reduce embarrassment I timed my farts to
the beat of the music. After a couple of songs I started to feel much better.
I finished my coffee and noticed that everyone was staring at me….

  

  

  

I suddenly remembered that I was listening to my Ipod…….. and how was your
day?
