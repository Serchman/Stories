**** Intro:** I lampoon ridiculous, idiotic, nonsensical, overly dramatic, and unintentionally hilarious real life Facebook posts that I observed during my time on that site. Some of these may seem familiar to the average Facebooker.

**_Frenetic Facebook Frenzy _**

**Note:** The posts, statuses, and comments detailed below are all real and were actually posted by people on Facebook when I was active on that site. The following is just my take on them, my lampooning of them, if you will.

**1/30:** This girl in my newsfeed goes, “OMG Kurt Cobain, he was fucked up.” Like its some shock someone with a heroin addiction and bi-polar disorder wasn’t exactly “normal!”

**2/30: **This former pornographic film actress in my newsfeed contemplated joining the Navy. I’d tell her commanding officer, I recommend her for submarine duty; she’s good at going down and is used to being surrounded by seamen.

**3/30: **A high school dropout in my newsfeed posted about how people should pay taxes for schools even if they don’t have children that go there. Yep, pay for those schools you thought were of such quality that you dropped out of them!

**4/30:** A single mother in my newsfeed asked her followers what kind of boyfriend she should get. I wanted to comment (but was too polite to)……………..how about a father-figure???

**5/30:** A girl in my newsfeed posted un-sarcastically, “I don’t NEED anyone!” She had 1,500 friends on Facebook. Hmm.

**6/30: **A girl in my newsfeed posted of seeing a crying Marine and calling it beautiful. Leave it to a girl to think the pain of a man is gorgeous! Reminds me how this girl I liked said of me, “You’re sexy, especially when depressed.”

**7/30:** Any post by girls about female body image is comical. Right now, I challenge you, go ask any guy and they’ll tell you they will accept a wide variety of girl. Now go ask any girl. Most only accept only one kind of guy.

**8/30:** My Pakistani friend posted how it was nice to hear fireworks in his city and not car bombs. I wondered, how could he tell the difference???

**9/30:** “Brunswick-bound” is always a funny status to see someone post. What a traffic nightmare that city is! “Brunswick bound;” literally you will be bound in one place for the next half hour as the light changes 16 times.

**10/30: **Someone working in the healthcare field in my newsfeed once posted, “Like OMG how could that guy in CT shoot little kids?” Uhh…..he had a severe mental disorder and an enabling parent, what’s so hard to understand about that? Shouldn’t someone in the healthcare field KNOW of something called psychology?

**11/30: **A girl wrote, “senior assassins=no friends for three weeks lol.” I wondered, would this girl turn into an actual assassin if all her friends just totally abandoned her and cut her off for three weeks? ………..yes.

**12/30**: An exotic dancer in my newsfeed complained of the quality of men she was meeting on the job. I don’t even need to say anything here……is she aware of where she works??

**13/30: **A hilarious picture in my newsfeed was one of an exotic dancer posted of herself in between takes at a photo-shoot. She looked SO uncomfortable, so sad, so apprehensive, like a soldier in WWI about to go over the top. Then lights, camera, action……she was all smiles!

**14/30:** An advertisement in my newsfeed for one of those tough guy competitions where you run an obstacle course, beckons, “If you’re NOT everyone, sign up!” It reminded me of Spongebob, “Hey I’m no wimp! I’m a jerk!”

**15/30:** There is a gay guy in my newsfeed who constantly, I mean every day, posts about his desire to kill/mutilate people he doesn’t like and how he wishes death/mutilation on others. Then one day he posts, “nice people take drugs.” Does he really consider himself a nice person with his murderous desires and constantly wishing death on others?

**16/30:** An exotic dancer in my newsfeed has a tattoo on her side that says, “Beauty is pain.” If I was the artist that tattooed that on her, I would have said before I started, “Beauty is about to become pain….literally!” Then I’d have started buzzing away.

**17/30: **Any post where girls complain about being cheated on is funny. Why? Because well one of the initial reasons girls are attracted to guys is for their ability to get girls (notice the plurality). Now that they’ve got you, you think they’re just going to stop because you’re so special right? Do you honestly think guys work out every day to get ONE girl? Do you think guys want to make six-figures so they can get ONE girl? Do you think guys want to get famous so they can get ONE girl? No!!!!!

**18/30:** One of the most hilarious “people” in my newsfeed is a white girl who lives, eats, and breathes the “ghetto” lifestyle. She never breaks character, never writes in anything but horrid slang, listens to nothing but rap/hip-hop, “dates” only black guys. However, the funniest thing about her to me is that she dislikes President Barack Obama. Ha ha! Her act is perfect aside from that!

**19/30: **Any anti-firearms post by my ex was funnily paradoxical. She LOVED criminals, every guy she “dated” had a record, all her friends were criminals/had records, both her brothers were drug dealers, something about crime just got her going. Most people are anti-gun because they are anti-crime. She was anti-gun because it’s trendy to be so and in reality was pro-crime.

**20/30:** If you were to read the post literally and truthfully, it would have read, “HEY I’m a girl who is over 18 who put a clothed, non-nude, non-sexual picture of me on a website and let the public view it, now some EVIL guy took the picture and put it on his website where girls are ranked on looks. I’m SO offended, I’m calling the police!” Calling the police??? I still can’t believe this girl thought being judged on her looks by a picture she made public was worthy of a 911 call.

**21/30: **This girl in my newsfeed says after the Boston Bombing, “why would someone do this? because they’re bored?” This level of stupidity is always stunning to me. Does she know we’ve been at war for 12 years? Does she know the media has made mass murder the fastest way to get famous in America? Does she know criminals aren’t always rational and possessing of “good reasons” for doing things? I guess not!

**22/30:** The best comment made about me was some guy white-knighting for his prejudiced girlfriend after I called her out on the composition of the Zimmerman jury. He simply wrote, “You hate America.” Ha ha!!!

**23/30:** One of the funniest series of posts ever to explode the newsfeed was by this big Italian girl who had broken up with her “gangsta” boyfriend then seriously posted about how she learned her lesson every five minutes for literally days on end. The punchline? She wound up getting back together with him! Ha ha!!!!

**24/30:** One time a girl made a status about Indian people smelling bad; this spawned a huge argument between her, her friends, and random Indians. Her mother actually joined in and started fighting on her side. This is why America is doomed. The parents are no better than the children they have!

**25/30:** The most ridiculous relationship in my newsfeed was a 17 to 19 year old girl married to a late 30s to early 40s male career Marine Corps sergeant. The marriage ended so badly the girl became a stripper and vowed never to marry again. If I were representing the sergeant in court, I’d dress him up like Emperor Palpatine and make the case that an old war vet shouldn’t have his coffers pillaged by a dumb young girl.

**26/30: **“Sleep” or “I’m going to bed” is another ridiculous post one often sees. Oh you’re SO important, the world is just hounding after you, we need to be told you’re asleep. I’ll hang up the red telephone when the Russians call about nuclear war, Mr./Mrs. President, telling them, “Hey check his/her status, they’re asleep.”

**27/30:** Posts along the lines of “I don’t want to talk to anyone for blah, blah amount of time” are loony too. Oh how will the world survive as you throw your tantrum? How will we ever go on? Of course, all of these posts spawn dozens of comments asking why the person is checking out for a while. That’s probably their intended purpose.

**28/30: **The worst posts ever are those that show something disgusting like an abused animal or disfigured person. Imagine if you were on the street and a “friend” ran up to you and shoved a picture of a dog with its face half blown off by a firecracker in your face. You’d push them away and curse them! Why do people think this is okay to do?? Typical online morality slippage?

**29/30: **Guilt/outrage posts are another pathetic online foray. “Like if you’re against cancer, racism, domestic abuse, animal cruelty long lines at the post office” and so on into infinity. Naturally, liking does nothing and proves nothing. Whats the purpose of this? You didn’t take a stand, you clicked a button!

**30/30:** Ultimately social media works out quite well for those who run the world. People like, post, comment, and vent and that counts as their revolution, their social activism, their uprising, their resistance. In reality, nothing has been done, the citizen logs off, and goes right back into complacency, happy that they’ve “done their part.”
