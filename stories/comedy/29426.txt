# Safari to Egaleo

by Alexis Kypridemos

"Where to?" the cabbie asked.

"Egaleo," Leon said.

The cabbie didn't bother saying no. He just moved on to the next customer, a
withered old man.

"Hell," the old man croaked.

"OK," the cabbie said.

The old man got in the cab.

"And step on it, will ya? I'm in a hurry," he said.

Six hours later, clutching his aching belly in the hallway of the Nikea State
Hospital, not far from Egaleo, Leon was pretty sure that incident had been an
omen.

When the cab hadn't worked out, Leon had taken the subway to the end of the
line, and walked the rest of the way to his old buddy Jimmy's house. On the
way there, he had witnessed a stray dog drink another's urine, straight from
the tap, so to speak. That too should have been an omen. Leon pushed on toward
Jimmy's.

Once there, Jimmy had convinced him to go out for drinks. 'Drinks' meant wine
in plastic bottles from the neighborhood liquor store. But that had been only
the beginning.

Across the hospital hall, another drunk, also clutching his belly, nodded at
Leon.

"Abelia," Leon answered the unspoken question, naming the brand of dirt cheap
white wine which had put him there.

"And you?" Leon asked the drunk.

"Queen Margaret," the drunk said, mentioning a brand of mature Romanian
"Scotch."

Leon nodded sympathetically. He had to admit, that topped his wine
misadventure.

"And what about him?" the drunk asked, and jerked his chin toward two legs
pointing up at the sky. The legs were Jimmy's, who lay passed out on the
floor.

"Molotov," Leon said, mentioning the most dreaded of the three euro vodkas.
The drunk winced. That took the cake.
