**** Intro:** Two ex-navy seals meet on a cruise ship, both on honeymoons with their wives. Coincidentally their cabin rooms are next to each other and one couple overhears the other in their cabin at night to an odd humorous situation.

After the wedding me and my wife Melissa decided to take a honeymoon on a
cruise ship. As if by faith I met my navy buddy and I was flabbergasted that
they were on their second honeymoon after twelve years. As who would have
guessed that it so happened he was in the next room over so we saw each other
often to talk about our days at sea as our wives really listen with interest
(not).

Anyway my new bride bought a pair of shoes off shore which got increasingly
tighter and tighter as the day went on.  
That night after the festivities were finally over, she & I had retired to the
cabin room.  
  
Melissa flopped on the bed and said “Please remove my shoes darling, my feet’s
killing me”  
Ever obedient, as a newly married man I attacked her right shoe with vigor.  
  
But it would not budge.  
  
“Harder” yelled Melissa  
  
“Harder?” I yelled back, “I'm trying darling! But it's just so damn tight!”  
  
“Come on put some vigor in your muscle superman” she cried.  
  
Finally when it released, I let out a big groan, and Melissa exclaimed “Oh my
God, that feels so damn good” then she remarked, “I guess it was tight all
along!”  
  
In their bedroom next door my navy buddy turned to his wife and said,  
“See, I told you she must have been virgin with a face like that!”

I just barely heard what he said through the walls and hoped my darling
Melissa didn't as she was caressing her one sore foot.

  
Taking a brief pause out of that moment I relized that my job wasn't done. I
was attempting to remove the other shoe when I cried out “Oh god, darling this
one’s even tighter”  
  
At which point my navy buddy turned and said to the his wife:  
“That's my boy, once a Navy man, always a Navy man!” then his wife commented,
“You navy boys really get to the bottom of things, don’t you?!”
