# Cortex

by Alexis Kypridemos

"It's your choice," Orpheus said to Leo, holding out his hands. There was a
pill in each hand; one red, one blue.

"Take the red pill and you join us. Take the blue and you return to reality."

Leo accepted the pills, but they fell through the gaps between his dainty
fingers.

"Oh, shucks," Leo muttered and leaned down to find the pills. They'd fallen on
the woolly rug under the table. Leo looked under the table and saw a pill. He
couldn't remember which pill did what, but since he'd found one... He reached
out and grabbed it.

The pill was neither red nor blue. Instead it was off-white and had a little
bicycle etched on it. What the hell, Leo thought, and swallowed the pill.

He became engulfed by intense sound and colors. Wonderful colors. Orpheus'
voice was distant, "Hey! Hey, stop tripping out!"
