Monday

A week of the new school had officially been over and a bit of the excitement
died down now that we hit our 2nd week. Bert and I were standing talking by
the outside eating area against the walls of our school.

“So it’s been a week,” Bert said trying to imply something.

“I know?”

“Haven’t you noticed? someone’s been missing since school started?”

_Who? _“I’m lost.”

“Michelle.”

Whoa. That realization hit me hard. I had almost forgotten she existed. For a
whole week I hadn’t seen her. Actually not since the beginning of summer.
“Shit.” I was a bit concerned.

“Yah. I know. Where is she?”

“Camp’s got to be over by now. Where is she?” I missed my stalker.

“Whoa.” I looked at Bert but he wasn’t looking at me. His attention was behind
me. He stared intensely and shocked with his mouth open.

“What?” I turned around to see and boy was it a sight. It was Michelle.
Everyone stopped what they were doing and just stared shocked as they watched
her make her entrance. They weren’t staring for just any reason. The Fat Camp
worked.

Michelle was…..thin. And boy did she know it. Not one once of attention went
to waste. She loved it. She flashed a smile and set her eyes on Bert and I and
made her way to us.

“Hey Boys.”

“Oh my god Michelle! You’re-”

“Skinny, I know. It’s amazing where eating right and exercise will take you.”

“Whoa,” was the first thing out of Bert’s mouth. He was still schocked.

“I know. It takes a few moments to take in.”

I spread open my hands to hug her. I would usually be afraid of her never
letting me go, but I risked it.

“Chuck, I sensed that.” She was still grinning. “You don’t have to worry. The
stalker phase is over. I’m not going to watch you sleep anymore.”

“What?” Bert and I said?”

“I’m done with that. This summer I got a chance to grow mentally and shrink
physically. I wanna be you friend, Chuck, not your fear.”

“I don’t know what to say.”

“Just admire the new Michelle.”

“So you got rid of all of the pictures and pieces of my hair in your room?”

“I just got back today, so I’ll be spending the week throwing out all of my
files on you, pictures of you, and dildos.”

“What?”

“Oh yeah, you’ll find this hilarious. Last year I got a dildo modeled after
you penis.” She laughed, I didn’t. “Good times, good times. But it’s over.
Michelle’s got bigger things planned for her senior year. Great talking to you
two, but I gotta go make an entrance in the hallway. Toodles!”
