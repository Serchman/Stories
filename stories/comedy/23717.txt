STALKING THERESA WALLIS

About three years ago my shrink suggested that I quit trying to be a rockstar
so I started shopping at Talbott's and made "Police Woman" Angie Dickenson my
new paradigm of a hot, mature woman. Ironically, that week the National
Enquirer featured a story entitled: Angie Dickenson's Sad Last Days.

What was it about being a rockstar?

My life: Wanting so much to be cool. Being cool. Being not-cool again.

I had an ongoing dialogue with my mirror who exclaimed increasingly: "God!
Ugh! Revolting! It must be the light."

Yet, in the past two weeks I'd started to take care of myself. I quit smoking.
I went half-vegan. I reduced wine intake.

Exercise? Just a wild romp with tatted up, twentynine year old boyfriend who's
in a metal band. That'll do.

Mirror: "You were promiscuous once, but now that's gross."

Remembering wanting to be popular. Back in England in the seventies where you
attended boarding school. Wanting to be liked by all those snotty little
English bitches. Taxonomy of cool based on geographic origin and money - only
the girls who lived so far away that they boarded at the school were looked up
to. My "day-girl" status did not rate and spoiled my game. I wanted to be
friends with Theresa Wallis. She was pretty, rich, aristocratic, Catholic, and
very, very funny. A "pony girl" I believe that she enjoyed my company one on
one, but definitely not in front of the other boarders. In public she returned
letters I had written to her with a polite note asking me please not to write
her anymore letters because she did not want to have to write back. Of course,
her manners dictated all....I should have kept writhing to her just to torture
her gentile sense of obligation.

If Theresa was a rockstar, I wonder what she's like now.
