Em  
Blood drops on roses, and death to foe wishes  
  
Cmaj7  
Weighted down mobsters sleeping with fishes  
  
Am7 D7 G C  
Brown paper packages tied up with strings  
  
G C/E F#m B7  
These are a few of my favourite things  
  
  
  
Em  
I've made my bones, and I've paid my dues  
  
Cmaj7  
I'll make them offers they cannot refuse  
  
Am7 D7 G C  
Family come first, before God and all kings  
  
G C/E F#m B7  
These are a few of my favourite things  
  
  
  
Em  
If they refuse me, I'll take it with force  
  
Cmaj7  
Maybe by muscle, or the head of a horse  
  
Am7 D7 G C  
I'm not a puppet on anyone's strings  
  
G C/E F#m B7  
These are a few of my favourite things  
  
  
  
Em  
When the gun blasts  
  
Am B7  
When the knife stabs  
  
Em C  
When I'm feeling sad  
  
C Am G C  
I simply remember my favourite things  
  
Am D7 G  
And then I don't feel so bad
