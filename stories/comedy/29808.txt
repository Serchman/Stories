Just wanted to express how sorry I am on how late this is. I've been so busy,
this being my senior year, and i didn't have enough time to give this project
my full attention. But, I'm out of school now and I'll try to get this done
ASAP. But, here's another snippet 'til then.

_ F*ck My Life! Sneak Peek 2_

The grass was greener than ever before and the sun shined on my face. I just
stared at this building as the many teens walked into it. I’ve waited so long
for this moment. For this day. The beginning of the end. The countdown to when
I actually get to leave home. Today. The day. The first day.

Of my Senior Year.

The hallways were buzzing with sound and I was actually…happy. High school
definitely was not the best part of my life, but things were coming to a
close. 9 more months of this and I’m free.

“Hey! Chuck!” I gladly turned around to that familiar friendly face.

“Bert, what’s up?” We bro-hugged.

“Dude it’s here! We are KINGS of the school. To think we started off as nerdy
freshman.”

“I’m still a nerd I’d say. YOU’RE the king of the school. I’ll still be thrown
in the trash. Literally.”

“Don’t even worry my friend. As captain of the football team you are off limit
to any bullying by the guys. You’re in the clear this year.”

“Man in charge. I like it.”

“Hey, I gotta make sure my best bro and I have THE best senior year.”

“Great because I don’t think after all that break up shit I went through
Junior Year, I could handle more drama.”

“Drama free year my man. And I am a shoe in for prom king.”

“Ha! You’re already thinking about prom?”

“Dude. Prom King is the ultimate status symbol. If I win prom king, I would’ve
gotten everything I ever wanted. Popularity. Admiration. Power. I’ll finally
be on top. This is the last chance before college to be who we want to be. Who
do you want to be?”

“Whoa. Where do I begin? Different.”

“What? That’s vague.”

“Different. Completely different. I want to become a completely different
person. The opposite of who I am now. A king. I know it sounds so childish
but, I want that.” _I just don’t know if I can have it._

“If there’s any time to do it, it’s now Chuck. Play your cards right this
year, and you’ll get yourself on track for the life you want.”

“And be king.”

“And be king.” Bert raised his fist in the air and yelled, “class of 2014 WE
ARE THE KINGS!”

“WOOOOOOO!” They howled at the top of their lungs bellowing with glee.

Senior year was kicking off great. But it would soon go off with a bang.
