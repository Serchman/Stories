**** Intro:** When Operation Market-Garden, the largest airborne assault e-v-e-r ever at the time, is launched in World War II, it runs into many problems, most of which can best be related by a Panic! at the Disco song.

**_Operation Supermarket-Garden_**

**_September 17, 1944: some tiny Dutch village with an unpronounceable name near the city of Arnhem in occupied Holland_**

Two young Dutch women, Anne and Frank, are sitting on the steps of their
quaint house, having a “girl talk.” They are both rather good looking, but
quite tall. However, one must remember, they’re all the same height once you
lay them down. They’re so engrossed in their girl talk, they don’t notice that
the sun above their petite village is being blotted out by hundreds, if not
thousands of American and British cargo planes, each spitting out a long
stream of paratroopers. Their village has been occupied by the goose-steppers
for over four years now, nothing impresses them anymore. Their girl talk is
infinitely more important than World War II.

Flying haphazardly toward their position, awkwardly wrestling with his
parachute cord, is none other than American 82nd Airborne Division paratrooper
Sergeant Jefferson Davis Redcorn IV. He embodies the nickname of his division,
“All-American.” He joined the Army to fight for freedom (he was drafted) and
volunteered to be a paratrooper because he wanted to be challenged (actually
wanted that extra hazardous duty pay), and he is so happy and excited to be a
part of this airborne operation today (really, he couldn’t care less if Adolf
Hitler, Winston Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt, “Upper Decky” Hideki Tojo, Juan
Peron, Josef Stalin, Charles DeGualle, and Mahatma Ghandi all smoked a peace
pipe tomorrow and jointly decided that everyone should just go home, what he_
is_ really excited for is he hears Dutch women are at least semi-good looking
compared to British girls). Just as he is fifty feet from a happy landing, a
flock of birds flies straight into his parachute (bird strike!!), causing his
chute to fold up like a picnic blanket caught by the wind. Helplessly, but
still bothering to let out a long “aaaaaahhhhhhhhh” he falls the last fifty
feet to the cold, hard ground, landing face first right in front of the girl
talking Anne and Frank. SPLUT!

The two women glance over at his corpse, looking concerned, but not_ too_
concerned. Slowly, Sergeant Redcorn lifts his head up, a flight of tiny
chirping birds circle his head like in a cartoon. His helmet has “PDG” written
on it and somehow managed not to fall off during his free fall. He staggers to
his feet, beaten but no worse for wear, and lets out a five to ten second
long, hearty belch. After he finishes he notices the two nearby Dutch women,
who are still determining if they should interrupt their girl talk or not for
this. Embarrassed, Sergeant Redcorn turns fire truck red (how appropriate) in
shame and immediately marches over to the pair.

“Hi there, I’m an American soldier; I’m here to liberate you from the **evil**
Nazis!” he sharply introduces himself and gets right to the point.

“**Evil**?” Anne asks, apparently surprised at the assessment.

“Well, they’re not soooo bad, I mean all they did was confiscate all the
firearms in town and require a permit for outside travel,” Frank chimes in and
explains.

“WHAT? They took your guns? That’s a constitutional right where I come from!
I’ll show ‘em! Why I oughta!” Sergeant Redcorn rages, completely
flabbergasted. This really broke his grill, guys.

“A _right_? Well, your crime rate must be very high,” Anne scoffs,
incredulous.

“Yeah, guns cause crime!” Frank screeches in a “na na I told ya so” tone.

“Uh, I think you meant to say Prohibition. Actually crime is at a low right
now and people are living better than ever! Women, kids, Afro-Americans, they
all got themselves high paying defense industry jobs! Prohibition is gone, the
Great Depression is over! Hell, even our rioters wear zoot suits!” Sergeant
Redcorn eagerly elaborates on the American Dream for them.

Anne and Frank don’t even reply, they just give him “_the look_,” you know
what I mean.

“Well, anyway, got to get on with the war,” Sergeant Redcorn concludes,
despaired a little that they don’t see his point. He walks off, his head hung
in dejection.

Anne and Frank dive back into their girl talk, barely getting around to their
favorite topic of “guess who died” before up their street a British
paratrooper comes stomping along. He’s donning his class-A dress uniform,
ironed pants, tie, and all. He also wears a bright red beret (with the
initials PDG on it), apparently not too concerned about snipers.

Spotting the twosome, Lieutenant Nigel Mark Thomas-John Steve Harry Mark Carl
Pillingsworth of Her Majesty the Reptile’s Grand Army makes a beeline for
them, stroking his miniscule mustache, excited to liberate his first grateful
Dutch citizens.

“Good day, madams, I’m a member of Her Majesty the Reptile’s Grand Army and
I’m here to officially liberate you from those **evil **Nazis who want to
conquer the world!” Lieutenant Pillingsworth declares to the uninterested
women.

“Wait, conquer the world? Aren’t you British?” Anne questions him, doubting
her liberators yet again.

“Yeah, you know, the people who conquered one-fourth of the entire world and
own several slave states in Africa and Asia currently…” Frank says in an
accusatory tone, completing her friend’s thought.

“Well, erm, well, ah, ya see…” Lieutenant Pillingsworth mutters, utterly
stupefied.

“Yeah, how do we know you won’t take over us next?” Anne interjects, outraged,
demanding an explanation.

“Uh, well, we have a nicer flag for one, well, uh, at any rate, I think it’s
tea time! Toodlepip!” Lieutenant Pillingsworth stutters before quickly
clomping off, all too eager to get away from the troublesome duo.

Anne and Frank get back to their girl talk, but only manage a sentence or two
of “so-and-so did whattt” before they hear a strange flapping sound coming
down their street.

Approaching them is a slovenly, visibly dazed and confused Polish soldier.
Perhaps he’s just Polish though and neither dazed nor confused. His coat is
buttoned one button off the whole way down and he is only wearing one shoe.
His whole appearance is one of unkemptness. His helmet has PDG sloppily
scrawled on it’s side. Since he only has one shoe on his bare foot makes a
slapping sound on the cobblestone road with each step. He saunters up to the
women, wobbling with each step.

“Uh, is this Poland?” he asks in a slow drawl.

“…………….No,” Anne answers, annoyed at yet another interruption to their girl
talk.

“Ohh……………” the Pole trails off in realization.

The Polish soldier walks off and goes around the block. Then he walks around
the block again only backwards this time thus arriving exactly back where he
started, right in front of the vexed Dutch women.

“Uh, is this Poland _now_?” the Pole inquires again, hopefully.

“……………….No,” Frank replies this time, irritated beyond belief at his
stupidity.

The Pole shrugs and walks off, happily continuing to flap along till he finds
Poland again.

*******

A street over, two American soldiers advance at slow walk, their rifles
pointed forward, ready for action at any second. One of the soldiers eyes a
nearby building that has a little whitebeareded wizard on it accompanying the
words, “I, Smoke.” It’s a recreational mariel-wanna lounge, but hell if
they’ve ever seen one before. The wizard’s pointy hat is down over his eyes,
presumably hiding the fact that he’s stoned and his eyes are bloodshot.

“Uh, is THAT Wizard Whitebeard?” the observant soldier queries his partner
whilst pointing at the shop, still stuck on the _Where’s Waldo?_ game they
were playing on the flight over. _Where’s Waldo?_ exists in 1944 due to a
timeline shift similar to the inexplicable _BerenSTEIN Bears_ changing to
_BerenSTAIN Bears _shift. Seems some Illuminati curmudgeon wanted to get in on
the lucrative _Where’s Waldo? _enterprise a little early.

“……………….No,” the soldier’s squadmate retorts, pissed that his partner can’t
focus on the war and is fixated on their _Where’s Waldo? _game instead.

Back over on the adjacent street, Sergeant Redcorn was just getting over his
crushing despair regarding his liberatee’s lack of enthusiasm when Private
First Class Roy G. Biv bounded up to him and made his report in the manner of
a song.

“Sir,  
Just imagine,  
As I'm combing the streets I come upon a mariel -wanna store,  
And I can't help but to hear,  
No, I can't help but to hear an exchanging of words:  
"What a beautiful country! What a beautiful country!" says the resistance
chief to his subordinate,  
"And, yes, but what a shame, what a shame all our women turned out to be
collaborator whores.”

“Then I chime in with a  
"Haven't you Dutchies ever heard of watching your goddamn whores?!"  
No, it's much better to let ‘em go on their way  
and betray their own nationality!

“Then I chime in with a  
"Haven't you Dutchies ever heard of watching your goddamn whores?!"  
No, it's much better to let ‘em go on their way  
and betray their own….”

Private Biv is prepared to sing on before Sergeant Redcorn cuts him off
harshly, abruptly, “That’s enough Private, that’s quite enough, we’re right
here!”

Private Biv falls silent. Dejected, he turns away and sits down on his helmet,
which has PDG stenciled on it’s side, of course.

Before Sergeant Redcorn can chew out Private Biv any further, Private Dignit
ambles up to Sergeant Redcorn with the most breaking development of the
operation yet. He and his squadmate have located a secret message from the
Dutch underground left on the plastic casing of an apple pie. Surely, it
contains a message of extreme importance and relevance.

“Here ya go Sarn’t, now all ya gotta do is decode it, should be EZ-PZ,”
Private Dignit twangs as he hands over the apple pie to Sergeant Redcorn. The
“D” in the “PDG” on his helmet is in red because he’s Dignit dammit.

“Excellent work Private! Prepare to move out, Private Biv and I will decode
this message momentarily,” Sergeant Redcorn praises his subordinate, exuberant
that the operation is going as planned.

Private Dignit strolls off to banter with his squadmate Private Mann, someone
so chill and so lackadaisical, he doesn’t walk through life, he’s pushed. When
he got his draft notice he simply sighed, “Eh, oh well.” The PDG on his helmet
may stand for “partying, drinking, getting it in,” but he does none of the
three.

Sergeant Redcorn calls Private Biv over and together they begin to decipher
the message from the Dutch underground.

*****

Several minutes pass and the two soldiers are still struggling to make any
sense of the code, they constantly rankle the pie’s casing, murmuring to
themselves.

“Ukraine? How did this get all the way here from Ukraine?........That means it
was old in the Ukraine, now it’s old…._here_!” Sergeant Redcorn talks to
himself aloud, questioning the pie’s mysterious origins.

Behind the two puzzled soldiers, Private Dignit continues on being Private
Dignit.

“So is milk like a cow’s piss or something?” he wonders aloud to Private Mann.

“Idunno…” Private Mann grunts.

“_Two hours later_,” a SpongeBob-esque French drawl informs us as time drags
on.

“Uh, I got an H, did you get an H?” Sergeant Redcorn inquires, still besieged
by the message’s cipher.

“……………..No,” Private Biv mumbles, aggravated more by his own inability to
figure out the code language than by Sergeant Redcorn.

Over their shoulders, Privates Dignit and Mann still patiently await their
orders.

“So can you get high on air? Like if you had a can of air, could you inhale it
and get high? From like canned air?” Private Dignit deliberates out loud.

“Idunno…” Private Mann snorts, uncaring and unknowing.

“_Twenty hours later_,” the SpongeBob-esque French drawl chimes in again.

It looks like it is nighttime out now, Private Biv is missing from the scene,
and Sergeant Redcorn continues to anxiously twist and manipulate the pie
wrapper.

“Ah, okay! So if I have this correct, the secret message is, “Pick up Bart,””
Sergeant Redcorn finally announces, triumphantly, but at the same time
baffled.

Despite begin within earshot Private Dignit neither hears nor cares.

“……..and you go up, and that counts as one. That’s a dick-up, you can only do
one, that’s the achievement Mann,” Private Dignit enlightens his squadmate.

Private Mann is sleeping standing up, but since he sleeps with his eyes open
and rarely talks to begin with, no one knows the difference.

Down the street, Anne and Frank are just about to conclude their all-important
girl talk. Anne tries to look on the bright side of things………in song.

“Hmm, well in fact,  
Well I'll look at it this way,  
I mean technically our country is saved  
Well that calls for a toast  
So, pour the champagne!”

Following her friend’s suit, Frank responds, also in song,

“Yes, well in fact,  
I look at it this way,  
I mean technically our country is saved  
That calls for a toast  
I’ll pour the champagne! I’ll pour the champagne!”

Frank, after finishing her verse, runs inside the charming little house they
are sitting on the steps of, only to emerge moments later holding a champagne
bottle labeled nothing other than “PDG.”

\--According to Siegfried Knappe in _Soldat: Reflections of a German Soldier
1936-1949_, the Germans did confiscate all firearms when they occupied a town
and did require a special permit for outside travel, but otherwise much was
unchanged. Mr. Knappe further stated that being stationed in France was more
comfortable than being stationed in Germany, due to France’s lack of war
rationing.

\--“PDG,” party, drink, get it in, was a local rapper’s motto I saw painted on
the side of a van.

\--During the zoot suit riots of the 1940s, people did wear finely tailored,
expensive suits while rioting.

\--I knew a Private Mann and a Captain Mann in the RL (real life).

\--Why the choice of Panic! at the Disco? I saw a picture of a sim who looked
like their lead singer with the caption, “I write sims not tragedies” just
before I wrote this.

\--In a recent news story, a woman did get high on canned air at a Walmart.

\--“I, Smoke” is the name of a mariel-wanna lounge I saw in the Netherlands
that had a wizard for it’s logo.

\--Roygbiv an acronym one of my art teachers used to help us remember the
color spectrum.
