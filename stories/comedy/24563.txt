**** Intro:** A short story about a family tradition that isn't appreciated 

* * *

When they walked back from their parents grave, Jane confronted her older
brother James about the yearly family dinner.  
“Now mother has passed away, can we stop eating boiled liver?”  
“You want to dishonor the memories of our parents?” James replied.  
“Mother ate it because father ate it..”  
“Mother always respected father.”  
“But father ate it because mother cooked it. “  
“Father was always respectful to mother.”  
“But it tastes horrible!” Jane choked..  
“I know.”  
One day I’ll be the head of the family, Jane thought bitterly.  
When they reached the exit, Johnny, James eldest son, ran up to them  
“Dad! Guess what’s for dinner! Grandma would be so proud of us!”
