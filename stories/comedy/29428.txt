# Tipster

by Alexis Kypridemos

** **

Detective Richard "Dick" Tuggs flipped his notebook closed as the door to an
apartment closed, wrapping up what seemed to be the last of a long series of
fruitless interviews. Tuggs looked tired. Tuggs' partner, Croquet, walked up
to him, also holding a notebook.

"Learn anything?" Croquet asked.

"Nope," Tuggs said.

Crocket looked at his watch.

"Lunch?"

Tuggs made a face of deep thought as he rested a hand on his belly.

"Why not? I know a place a few blocks up."

An apartment door opened a crack and a Chinese man observed them suspiciously
from inside the apartment as they walked down the stairs.

A few blocks down, Tuggs and Croquet entered Sam's Deli. Tuggs greeted Sam,
the owner, and they started to chat. Meanwhile, the suspicious-looking Chinese
man walked into the deli and headed for the bathroom. This was not lost on
Tuggs, who watched him out of the corner of his eye. He drew his gun.

"What’s up?" Croquet asked.

"Stay here," Tuggs said. He walked slowly toward the bathroom, gun at the
ready.

In the bathroom, a man was peeing at one urinal, as the Chinese man unzipped
at another. Tuggs walked in stealthily and aimed his gun at the Chinese man.

"OK, hold it!" Tuggs ordered.

The other man stopped peeing. The Chinese man froze, hands on his fly.

"Hands where I can see them!"

The other man held his hands in the air and squeezed both knees together in an
effort to contain himself.

Tuggs walked up behind the Chinese man and pinned his hands up against the
wall.

"What’s your name?"

"Liu Ho," the Chinese man said.

"Where do you live?"

"Fourteen forty-four, East Third Street."

"You’ve been following us since the crime scene. What do you want?"

"I've got an anonymous tip."

"Let’s hear it."

"The guy you’re looking for, his name is Yang Yang."

"Yang Yang," Tuggs repeated. "Can you give me a physical description?"

"You kidding? He Chinese!"
