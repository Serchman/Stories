Is it Spring yet?

Or is it just me?

_Brrr!_

But I swear it's still fucking cold!

I forgot to put on a jacket as I headed for the door. Thinking it's only going
to be few minutes to smoke my clip. And while puffing I felt the wind smashing
against my chiseled six-pack of granite. I said, "Dayum! It's nippy out here!"

So fuck you Punxsutawney Phil!

Fuck you asshole groundhog!

You're more fuller shit than Bill Murray in Caddyshack eating chocolate shit
in a pool where everyone was convinced it was the real shit!

Yeah, you over grown rat!

I'm talking about your prediction with your shadow, yeah, bullshit!

You're so full of shit Phil, you're piece o' shit!

I wish you peace.

A long eternal peace.

Like seeing you on my rearview mirror as I'm driving away towards

SUMMER!

You deserve to be a roadkill !
