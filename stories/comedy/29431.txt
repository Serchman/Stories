# Up to Speed

by Alexis Kypridemos

Faulkner sat across from the General, listening to the radio chatter. They
were being informed, in real time, of the progress of Operation Flyswatter,
the hunting down of rogue Special Forces officer Mike Kelley.

Faulkner read Kelley's file to the General, to help him make his decisions.

“Kelley, Michael. Age: 40. Height: 5' 10."”

A voice spoke on the radio. It was the voice of the sergeant leading the
platoon assigned with hunting down Kelley. “We've got Kelley in our sights,
General,” he said. “Visibility conditions extremely poor... switching to night
vision.”

Faulkner continued reading Kelley’s file. “Distinguishing characteristics:
wears eyeglasses due to severe myopia.”

“Good,” the General said. “Our boys should have him.”

Sharp noises sounded from the radio.

“He's firing... Our snipers are down, our snipers are down!” the sergeant
yelled, his voice distorting.

“What in hell is going on over there?!” the General asked. There was no reply.

Faulkner read the next paragraph of Kelley’s file. “LASIK surgery, five years
ago. Outcome successful. Marksman training, three years. It seems he’s a crack
shot, sir.”

The General looked up slowly from the radio receiver. “Thank you for keeping
us up to speed, Faulkner.”
