"Well, now that we have exchanged the information, let's date our next
meeting."

A man who said it, was in his mid forties, overweight and balding. He was
sitting at the end of a wooden bench overlooking a neglected small pond.

At the other end, sat his interlocutor - a younger man, thin, long haired and
pale faced. They both were acting as if had nothing to do with each other –
one was reading a paper, the other looking intently at the cloudy sky. Their
lips were hardly moving and there was no eye contact between them.

"Well, we need to get some additional information... Is the day after tomorrow
alright?" asked the thin man.

"Absolutely. What time?"

"Will an hour before lunch suit you?"

"Perfectly. What place?"

" Why d'you ask? Is there a need to change the venue?"

"Of course not, everything's alright, I just wanted you opinion." The bald man
looked around to make sure they weren't being overheard, then lowered his
voice to nearly a whisper. "How will I know that you're ready to get in
contact?"

"Well, let me think...", there followed a brief pause. "What do you say to my
holding a copy of Mental Health Today in the left hand, a Rolex with a
distinctive blue dial worn on the right and a daffodil buttonhole?"

"Terrific, but the latter seems to be obviously excessive with the other two.
Omit it."

"Whatever you say – you are the chief", agreed the pale faced one. "What about
the password? It's your turn to think it up, isn't it?"

"Yeah, well... I'll ask you where the nearest synagogue is."

"Brilliant! But please, chief, say it quieter this time. On the previous
occasion you drew needless attention to yourself."

"Okay", the bald man raised his left arm to check the time by the watch which
was painted with green felt pen on his wrist. "Lunch time in about half an
hour", he sighed.

"Yeah," the other acknowledged, inhaling deeply through his nose. "Cod in
parsley sauce and boiled potatoes and peas..."

"And sponge pudding and custard", added the chief, smiling, when a loud,
strict female voice cut across their conversation.

"Hey, Spies! You have to take your pills before meal time!
