**** Intro:** For anyone on their own this Christmas 

* * *

I got an email.

"Just like to say thanks for your stories. I am on my own this week and will
read some to keep my spirits up"

What can you say?

"Thanks for the email, why are you alone?"

Half an hour later

"Usual crap, divorced, my son has to go to his in laws because it is their
turn this year. Want any more misery?"

"Where do you live? Would you like a coffee on the motorway services. Oh
forget that it is hardly uplifting. How about a picnic?"

"Are you mad its Christmas, picnics are summer"

"No wear plenty of layers"

"What if I say I live in John o'Groats?"

"Then I better start driving now!"

"Just outside Reading. A picnic really?"

"Do you drive? I will meet you by the river next to the prison. Romantic eh?"

"Bloody Hell, you know how to treat a girl. Cavendish side 11 am Christmas
morning?"

"Done deal, if you see a guy who looks like a film star -that's me. Shrek!.
Here's a photo to help and the car registration and mobile phone number"

"Complete madness, what happens if you are a nutter?"

"You are safe, it is not a full moon until the evening. See you then"

So Christmas day sees me driving, very quiet yet but it will be madness later
when everyone has to go and visit Grannie. I make it in plenty of time. I have
made up a picnic and brought a flask. Anywhere open will be booked and grossly
overpriced.

Parked, got out had a walk to the bridge, walked back, had a chat with the
ducks.

No sign of my friend. ten past, my phone rings.

"You have stood me up"

"No my car won't start and it is a long wait today for the AA."

"OK picnic at your place if you tell me where it is, and you invite me"

She give me the address and I get it on my phone. Satnav is for wimps!

Ten minutes later I am driving along the side of the river and see the house
name.

Don't see a house, see a long winding drive. So I do a long winding drive down
the long winding drive until I come to something out of a film. Huge house,
grounds, stables or similar. Oh Dear.Not me at all. There is a woman standing
at the end of the drive.

"Hello, I assume you are James?"

"Yes, and hello and Merry Christmas to you"

"Oh and you"

And then we do the English thing of deciding what comes next, handshake, kiss
on the cheek, kiss on the lips. I settle for kiss on the cheek.

"Em, is this yours?" and I bring my hand round to take in the estate.

She laughs "No I am the housekeeper, the owners are in the Bahamas"

I breath a sigh of relief, that would have been so out my league.

"Come into the kitchen, I have your picnic ready"

"Oh I brought a picnic as well"

"Mix and match"

The kitchen alone is bigger than my house. Beautifully done and wreaking of
money.

We sit and share our meal and it is warm.

We talk about our lives and how we have come to be where we are.

We laugh and amuse ourselves and have a fine old time.

At five o'clock I say it is time for me to go back and she looks a bit
disappointed but understands. We repeat the kiss on the cheek, wish each other
Happy Christmas and wave good bye.

Weather isn't the best so it takes me three and a half hours to get home.

Get indoors, cup of tea and sit down.

Open my computer

"What about New Years Eve"
