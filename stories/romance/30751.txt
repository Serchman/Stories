** Jack and Isobel were best friends ever since Isobel was two years old and Jack was four years old. Isobel was a petite, brunette with cat like green eyes that pierced your soul when she looked you in the eyes. Jack was tall at the age of four when they first became friends and had dirty blonde hair and tantalizing blue eyes. **

** At the age of seventeen, Isobel was still petite but she was beginning to fill out like the young woman she was. She walked to Jack's house, which was two blocks away from their home. There was a pep in her step. She was happy to see Jack today, she missed him, they hadn't seen him in about a month. She paused when she heard his parents arguing with each other. She knocked on the door and the arguing ceased and his mother opened the door, "Isobel? What a surprise. I'm guessing you want to see Jack?"**

** Isobel shyly nodded and Michelle opened the door for her and stepped to the side to let her in the door. Isobel jogged up the stairs and knocked on the door, "Jack?"**

** Isobel heard scurrying about his room, and heard a girl's voice hiss, "Who's that?"**

** "It's Isobel, we had went to Italy and I'm guessing she came to visit me and my mom didn't tell her I had a guest." Jack was fixing his shirt as he opened the door for Isobel, "Hey..."**

** Isobel blushed at the revealing tank top clad girl and she dropped her gaze, clueless on what she just interrupted, "Ummm, I should go, shouldn't I?" She looked up at Jack and she turned away from him and hurried out of the the house and Jack cursed under his breath rushing after her. **

** "Isobel!" He caught her wrist as she got out of the house, he sighed and ran his tanned hand through his dirty blonde hair, his blue eyes showing clear annoyance. "Will you please listen to me?" He held onto her wrist tightly.**

** "Jack, you're hurting me..." Her green eyes were filling with tears and he loosened his grip on her wrist. **

** "Isobel, I'm so sorry. Please listen to me." Jack said softly and tilted her head to meet his dark blue eyes.**

** "Fine, you've got five minutes." Isobel sighed and looked down nervously. Jack growled and yanked her chin up to look at her, tears slowly began filling her green eyes. **

** He slowly said, "That was an ex, she's just a fling, but today I was desperate for sex, so I called her and asked if she'd want to help me with my 'problem'."**

** Isobel made a sound of disgust and yanked away from him, he yanked her towards him and she squeaked in shock as she felt his member throb against her lower abdobmen. Jack's face darkened as he blushed in embarrassment, he stepped back, "I'm sorry, and no I can't explain that reaction to you..."**

** Isobel pulled him into the shadows after closing the door so his parents wouldn't hear her, "Were you really going to have sex with her?" Tears brimmed her green eyes and she looked away from him.**

** "No, maybe, I don't know, Isobel." She visibly flinched and punched his chest as the tears of hurt fell down her pale cheeks. He caught her wrists and pulled her into a tight hug as she sobbed into his chest. Arabella walked out and looked at Isobel and mumbled, "I'll leave, Jack." He nodded and let her leave as he held Isobel close as he finally controlled his urge and his body relaxed as she cried. **

** Her iPhone 5c blasted 'If everyone cared' by Nickelback. She jumped away from him and checked the caller I.D. "I've gotta take this..." She walked out of ear shot and said, "Hello, Mitchell. What's up?"**

** Mitchell stated on the other end, "Did I interrupt something?"**

** Isobel shyly answered, "Um, no, I was just talking with Jack. He was with some girl named Arabella..." Her voice was tinged with jealousy and Mitchell laughed.**

** "Really Arabella, she's a class a whore! Did they do anything?" Mitchell urged Isobel to continue on with her jealous rant.**

** "Not that I know of because I interrupted them, is it bad he had a hard on while I was crying?"**

** Mitchell scoffed, "Well, you did interrupt him when they were probably about to fuck so yeah that's expected from his side."**

** Isobel sighed and hung up on him and walked back to Jack, "It was Mitchell."**

** "Oh. . ." Isobel noted the distaste on Jack's voice as he heard who called her. **

** "What's wrong, Jack?" Isobel asked curiously as she sensed his distaste for her friend, even though he was a gay friend didn't mean Jack had to hate Mitchell. **

** "Nothing, I just thought since it was summer you wouldn't be talking to that thing. He only ever used girls as an excuse to claim he was straight. Didn't he use you saying y'all slept together and that he took your virginity then everyone called you a slut? Wasn't that the big proclamation of sophmore year, Isobel?"**

** Pain lit in her green eyes as the memories of being insulted flooded back to her thoughts, her eyes glowed black and she shoved him in anger at the interruptions of peace of her mind. He stumbled slightly at the force she had used, his hands latched on her slim wrists as he fell back against the side of the house, "Shit!" He cursed as he felt the warmth of blood slip from her wrists, her eyes widened as the red blood stained her slightly see through red tank top. He knew she hated the sight of blood, her legs buckled and his hands latched on her hips and caught her and pulled her into his arms whispering, "Breathe, Isobel." Her eyes slipped shut as she passed out from nausea. He picked her up and carried her into the house and got his mother's attention to help clean up her bleeding wrists. **

** "What did you do?" She asked as she examined the scratch wounds.**

** "I had upset her and she shoved me and I fell back but I had a hold on her wrists and had scratched her and she hates the sight of blood and she passed out." He frowned and watched as his mom fixed Isobel's scratch wounds. **

** Isobel woke up about a few hours later in one of Michelle's white dresses without sleeves. The dress fit Isobel's form perfectly and it made her look like she was a super model. Jack walked out and his jaw hit the floor at the sight of Isobel standing up in the clinging dress, "Wow..." He couldn't even continue, she literally looked like a hot mess in the dress his mom changed her in, "Mom said you could stay for dinner, but I didn't know she was planning on taking us to a five star restuarant, you look uh... killer." **

** She blushed darkly and asked, "It's that bad, huh?"**

** "My god, no, it's not bad at all, you look stunning, completely amazing, gorgeous, beautiful." Jack stepped closer to her and she swallowed, looking down away from him.**

** He tilted her head and gently leaned down and gave her a kiss on her rose red lips. She weakly moaned in bliss as the kiss shook her body to the core, she stepped back and softly whimpered, "No, not right now, please Jack, you're my friend and you drive me crazy because how much I got jealous today when I saw you with Arabella. I wanted to rip her throat out when I knew that you wanted to have sex with with her." He met her gaze and held her hands gently, and sighed.**

** "I'm sorry that I ever called Arabella, Isobel, but I wasn't expecting to see you so soon after we just got home about ten hours ago, which reminds me, did you tell your parents that you would be over here?"**

** Isobel's eyes widened in embarrassment, "No, they're probably worried sick about me..." Just then Isobel's cell rang 'Concrete Angel' by Martina McBride, she quickly picked it up saying, "Hello, Mom..."**

** "Isobel, where are you? Did you even think to ask if you could leave for several hours without my permission?" Her mom's voice was filled with rage at the foolishness that her seventeen year old daughter had pulled. **

** "I'm at Jack's, mom, they just came home today, I thought you would've figured that out." The back sass in her tone said enough and she heard her parents arguing in irritation at the sign of retaliation. **

** She heard her mother say to her father, "She's getting it when she gets home."**

** Then her father said in the background, "Oh take a break, Ellen, she missed him."**

***********************************************************

** Her mother sighed and hung up the phone, looking at her husband, "She could've been hurt, Mike."**

** He soothed, "And is she, Ellen?" his beautiful wife slowly shook her head 'no' and he said, "Exactly. She's a big girl, hon, she can handle herself."**

********************************************************************

** Isobel shrugged at her mom hanging up on her and looked at Jack, "My mom is pissed at me for running off over here, my dad on the other hand understands. So I'm not sure if I'm in trouble or not when I go home." Jack laughed softly and lead Isobel to the car where his mom was waiting to take them to the restuarant and what they didn't know was that she had reserved it for just them so they could spend time together, Jack was always talking about how pretty Isobel looked even when she looked like a royal mess. So Michelle a week before reserved the spot for two for them to go on a secret date and had expected Isobel would come over when they had finally gotten home. **

** "Isobel, can you get me my purse, please?" Michelle asked as she held out her hand and was pulling to a stop in front of the most expensive restuarant in the state, Isobel looked at Jack and gave his mom her prada purse. "Give this to the cashier or waiter, either way it's the only way you two will get into the restuarant for your reservation for two." She handed Jack a reciept and waited for the two to get out of the car and watched as they slowly walked into the five star restuarant. She pulled away and left them as the door closed behind them.**

***********************************************************************

** **

** Isobel stood still as Jack showed the reciept to the server showing him the reservation for two under his last name, after the server requested I.D. Jack patiently showed him his I.D. and finally they were escorted throughout the restuarant into a dimly lit romantic feeling room and slow music playing while couples softly chattered. The white dress on Isobel stood out, making people turn their heads and gap at the young stunning couple that were being shown to their table.**

** "We're being watched. . ." Isobel whispered softly into Jack's ear and he smiled.**

** "Of course they're watching, you look like a celebrity in that dress, like drop dead gorgeous, Isobel." Her face blushed dark at his soft comment. He pulled out her chair as they were left alone at their table, "Well apparently mom made this reservation a week ago. I'm guessing you had no clue about it."**

** Isobel stated, "Had I known what your mom was up to I sure as hell wouldn't have been over there like two hours after y'all got home, I would've been running around looking for an outfit to wear, but apparently your mom was prepared already."**

** "She knows you, you were expected to come over and she knows what size you are, that dress, she bought it two days ago and said it was for her but obviously that wasn't the case. That dress makes you look like Aphrodite, absolutely amazing. Like you'd be the perfect---" Jack cut off, she had no clue his adoration for her. His dark blue eyes shined as the light bounced from the glass table into his eyes. She tilted her head curiously at his sudden cut-off. **

** She frowned and went to cross her legs and their feet brushed against the other's. "What were you going to say, Jack?"**

** Jack swallowed and looked away from her, "I was going to say that you look like the perfect bride, Isobel. . ."**

** She blushed darkly, "Um, wow, I wasn't expecting that." The violinist slowed the pace of the music and she bit her lip and gazed at him, "Thank you, Jack."**

** "Would you like to dance, Isobel?" Jack held out his hand towards her and she slowly stood up and took his hand, they both walked towards the dance floor and slowly began to dance, the chatter silenced as everyone watched the two slow dancing.**
