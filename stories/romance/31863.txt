" We're moving" said Luis with a sigh.

I looked at him in shock " WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN YOUR MOVING"

" Well my mom wants to move New york, she thinks it will be good for Jesse and
I. what good does it do you when you are being pulled away from the girl you
love."

I started crying. all luis could do was hold me and tell me it was going to be
okay but it wasnt.

"When?"

"Towards the end of the summer i know for sure by that I won't even start the
school year here."

I contined to cry to Luis he just cant leave me here all alone to go to New
York. I ended up falling asleep from crying so much and when I woke up he was
gone. It seemed as if a black hole was just consuming my heart. He just can't
leave i kept saying to myself. He can't.
