Carlotta’s POV

I stared into Jacob’s eyes. I didn’t know what Jared could do when he was mad
and I sure as hell didn’t want to find out. _Fuck,_ I thought. _Fuuckkkkkkkk…_

“What the fuck do you think you’re doing?” Jared breathed.

“I don’t see how this concerns you,” Jacob replied calmly. He didn’t take his
eyes off me, telling me that it was going to be okay, that he wasn’t going to
leave me alone.

“You know damn well how this concerns me,” Jared raged. I heard footsteps
pounding and coming closer but I didn’t dare look.

“Jared, I think you need to leave,” Jacob said.

“Now why the hell would I do that?”

“You’re scaring her.”

I felt someone grip my arm and hip and yank me away from Jacob. I screamed and
swung my leg out, coming in contact with Jared. He grit his teeth but didn’t
let go of me. Jacob lunged for his brother, pinning him to the ground.

Mr. and Mrs. Rosewater started yelling, and Sheera and I stood still, watching
the whole thing play out. We met each other’s eyes and knew that Jared really
needed help. Now. He’d kill Jacob if this carried on any longer.

Mr. Rosewater forced himself between Jacob and Jared. Jared turned away in a
huff and locked himself in his room while Jacob came to me and pulled me into
his strong arms. I pressed my face into his chest, breathing in his comforting
cologne. He was all I needed right now.

“Thank you,” I said, my voice muffled by his shirt.

His response was to hold me closer. I didn’t want him to ever let go.

I heard Mrs. Rosewater talking to Sheera but her voice faded away. All I heard
was the beating of Jacob’s heart as he picked me up and carried me to his
room. He gently laid me down on his bed and lay beside me. I closed my eyes
and rested my head beside his shoulder.

After a few minutes of peaceful silence, I felt small kisses on my neck and my
cheek and all over my face. I smiled and opened my eyes. He kissed my lips and
grinned back.

“I should be the one thanking you,” he murmured.

“What for?”

“For teaching me how to love again.”

I blushed and snuggled closer to him.

“I love you,” he said. “I fucking love you, Carlotta.”

My heart was about to burst. “I love you,” I answered.

He kissed me hard, pulling me on top of him. My hair fell like a curtain
around our heads. He looked into my eyes with so much love that it was all I
could do to keep myself from crying.

Right then, in that moment, he was all I needed, all I wanted, to breathe and
stay alive.
