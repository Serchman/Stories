Kate's Promise

I was born on June 27th 1985. It was a birth into a world that I can't really
say I wanted. For some of us, this world is not the same as for you, or most
people. I was abused, used, abandoned by someone I thought would never would,
homeless, alone, broke, working minimum wage jobs, and constantly in love with
Kate Winters.

I met Kate in high scool.

I loved her the first time I saw her. She was so pure, and seemed to be above
the base morals of our society. That would later change, as most people do
change over the course of their lives.

I will start this story where it ended, on a very cold winter night in
February. It was the last timeI saw her. It was the last time I ever saw her.
I was going crazy at the time, so I didn't really see her very well.

She started by talking about how I was not ugly, I was just avereage. I always
thought I was ugly. I found out later that several women wanted me, not just
Kate. I was rejected so many times in high school, that I don't even talk to
girls as anything other than just friends.

Kate was the only girl I had ever loved. She walked away from me. She promised
me the world, but left me because she was going bankrupt and had been seeing
another man named Brad.  
She knows what it looks like when I go crazy. She saw me the first time I went
crazy. It was because of her, and she did say that she understood that she was
the main cause of my first trip to the Behavioral Heatlth Unit.

I'm Bipolar, the really bad one that starts to hear voices if my condition
makes me stay up longer than 5 days. It happens if I don't take my medication.
Third time was the charm. I'll get more into the cause later.

Kate told me while I was in the bar that night that the other girls there were
just trying to get information from me for their cop friends, I'm a bit of an
outlaw and keep pace with several people they want.

. Kate saved me that night, they thought she was in on their little plot.  
Mary and Kate were not participating. I don't know Mary's motives. I don't
know if she was in on it, or not. She told me that she was pregnant. That she
knew I would make a good father.

I could make a very good father for her unborn child. But, I have never had
anything good in my life. It doesn't matter how much she needs me. I don't
have to live that way, under the burdens of someone else.

I've had enough of a hard life that the very least I deserve is a woman
without children. I wouldn't have said that five years ago, but I'm not who I
was back then. I used to be so nice. I'm polite now, there is a difference.

Kate was there to take me to vegas and marry me, she told me if I wasn't
crazy. I could have been married to my first love. She told me I was her first
love. So, off she went into his arms. Life isn't fair.  
I was offered the one thing in my life that could complete me. Then she told
me she could be with me after her grandma died. I know this happend, because I
didn't know about this other Brad.

She said that's what they call me, but he was really the other Brad, and that
I was her Brad. She told me not to contact her on facebook, she would block me
for appearances sake. She told me she would come for me after I had my own
house.

I'm very poor, on disability, and stuck in the small town in Missouri. She
told me she wouldn't live here, and I should move to Kansas City. She's the
reason I stay in this state.

I have done many things I am not proud of, sometimes for Kate.

She told me alot of things.  
Alone in this world I walk.  
I'm still waiting on her
